\section{Introduction}

This thesis contains two projects that were both completed during the three semesters of senior thesis. The first is a compression algorithm specification and implementation based on Huffman codes, and the second is an application of machine learning, namely genetic algorithms, to generate paintings in different styles based on a reference photo.
