adventure  i  a scandal in bohemiai
to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observer  excellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memoryi had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companionone night  it was on the twentieth of march 1888  i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the well remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my ownhis manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashionwedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw youseven  i answeredindeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harnessthen how do you know?i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it outhe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands togetherit is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical professioni could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yoursquite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this roomfrequentlyhow often?well some hundreds of timesthen how many are there?how many? i dont knowquite so  you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pink tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloudthe note was undated and without either signature or addressthere will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a maskthis is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means?i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it?i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was writtenthe man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiffpeculiar  that is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the lighti did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paperwhat do you make of that? asked holmesthe name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rathernot at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitz  here we are egria it is in a german speaking country  in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that? his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarettethe paper was made in bohemia i saidprecisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence  this account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubtsas he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistleda pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing elsei think that i had better go holmesnot a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss itbut your client  never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attentiona slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tapcome in  said holmesa man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacyyou had my note? he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to addresspray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address?you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alonei rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to methe count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european historyi promise said holmesand iyou will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my owni was aware of it said holmes drylythe circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemiai was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyesour visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic clientif your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise youthe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it?why indeed? murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel felstein and hereditary king of bohemiabut you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting youthen pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once morethe facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to youkindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fisheslet me see  said holmes hum  born in new jersey in the year 1858 contralto  hum  la scala hum  prima donna imperial opera of warsaw  yes  retired from operatic stage  ha  living in london  quite so  your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters backprecisely so but how  was there a secret marriage?noneno legal papers or certificates?nonethen i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity?there is the writingpooh pooh  forgerymy private note paperstolenmy own sealimitatedmy photographboughtwe were both in the photographoh dear  that is very bad  your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretioni was mad  insaneyou have compromised yourself seriouslyi was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty nowit must be recoveredwe have tried and failedyour majesty must pay it must be boughtshe will not sellstolen thenfive attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no resultno sign of it?absolutely noneholmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said hebut a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfullyvery indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph?to ruin mebut how?i am about to be marriedso i have heardto clotilde lothman von saxe meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an endand irene adler?threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go  noneyou are sure that she has not sent it yet?i am sureand why?because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next mondayoh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present?certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von krammthen i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progresspray do so i shall be all anxietythen as to money?you have carte blancheabsolutely?i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photographand for present expenses?the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the tablethere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he saidholmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note book and handed it to himand mademoiselles address? he askedis briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns woodholmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet?it wasthen good night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good night watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with youii
at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my headit was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken looking groom ill kempt and side whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minuteswell really  he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chairwhat is it?its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doingi cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adlerquite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sitting room on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interesti then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen toand what of irene adler? i askedoh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentine mews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaignthis godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client his friend or his mistress? if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situationi am following you closely i answeredi was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached  evidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at homehe was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross & hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutesthis was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twenty five minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the windmy cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried youll do come  come  what then? i asked come man come only three minutes or it wont be legali was half dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasionthis is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then?well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangementswhich are?some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your co operationi shall be delightedyou dont mind breaking the law?not in the leastnor running a chance of arrest?not in a good causeoh the cause is excellent then i am your mani was sure that i might rely on youbut what is it you wish?when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet herand what then?you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand?i am to be neutral?to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open windowyesyou are to watch me for i will be visible to youyesand when i raise my hand  so  you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me?entirelyit is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear?i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the streetpreciselythen you may entirely rely on methat is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to playhe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crimeit was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouthsyou see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph?where indeed?it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with herwhere then?her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else? she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own housebut it has twice been burgledpshaw  they did not know how to lookbut how will you look?i will not lookwhat then?i will get her to show mebut she will refuseshe will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letteras he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors grinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the streetis the poor gentleman much hurt? she askedhe is dead cried several voicesno no theres life in him  shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospitalhes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing nowhe cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm?surely bring him into the sitting room there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring anotherholmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire  the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and ill  gentlemen ostlers and servant maids  joined in a general shriek of fire  thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware roadyou did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all rightyou have the photograph?i know where it isand how did you find out?she showed me as i told you she wouldi am still in the darki do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the eveningi guessed as muchthen when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trickthat also i could fathomthen they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do? and into her sitting room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chancehow did that help you?it was all important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over precipitance may ruin alland now? i askedour quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own handsand when will you call?at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delaywe had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing saidgood night mister sherlock holmesthere were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried byive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have beeniii
i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the roomyou have really got it  he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his facenot yetbut you have hopes?i have hopesthen come i am all impatience to be gonewe must have a cabno my brougham is waitingthen that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodgeirene adler is married remarked holmesmarried  when?yesterdaybut to whom?to an english lawyer named nortonbut she could not love himi am in hopes that she doesand why in hopes?because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys planit is true and yet    well  i wish she had been of my own station  what a queen she would have made  he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenuethe door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the broughammr sherlock holmes i believe? said shei am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gazeindeed  my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 515 train from charing cross for the continentwhat  sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england?never to returnand the papers? asked the king hoarsely all is lostwe shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bell pull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this waymy dear mr sherlock holmes  you really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departedwell i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you good night and started for the temple to see my husbandwe both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes
very truly yours              
irene norton nee adlerwhat a woman  oh what a woman  cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity that she was not on my level?from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusionon the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the firei am glad to hear your majesty say soi am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring   he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his handyour majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmesyou have but to name itthis photograph the king stared at him in amazementirenes photograph  he cried certainly if you wish iti thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambersand that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the womanadventure  ii  the red headed league
i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout florid faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind meyou could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordiallyi was afraid that you were engagedso i am very much sothen i can wait in the next roomnot at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours alsothe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat encircled eyestry the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventuresyour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observedyou will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imaginationa proposition which i took the liberty of doubtingyou did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief uniquethe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearancei did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not over clean black frock coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his featuressherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing elsemr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companionhow in the name of good fortune did you know all that mr holmes? he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenteryour hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developedwell the snuff then and the freemasonry?i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc and compass breastpinah of course i forgot that but the writing?what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?well but china?the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain the matter becomes even more simplemr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never  said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after alli begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson?yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself siri took the paper from him and read as followsto the red headed league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services all red headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty one years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 popes court fleet streetwhat on earth does this mean? i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcementholmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it? said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the dateit is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months agovery good now mr wilson?well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the businesswhat is the name of this obliging youth? asked sherlock holmeshis name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head?why indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisementoh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in himhe is still with you i presume?yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean  thats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing morethe first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red headed man why that? i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the red headed men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then? i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stay at home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the red headed men? he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth? i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupationswell you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself red headed and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of red headed men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred poundsnow it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisementi never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with red headed folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were  straw lemon orange brick irish setter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the officeyour experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statementthere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson? have you a family?i answered that i had nothis face fell immediately dear me  he said gravely that is very serious indeed  i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelormy face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties? well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson  said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours? i asked ten to twonow a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before pay day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay? is $4 a week and the work? is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal? well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work? is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blotting paper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready to morrow? certainly i answered then good bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortunewell i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes courtwell to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me good day complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after methis went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of iteight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an endto an end?yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourselfhe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper it read in this fashion

preface
as things now stand the course of instruction in american history in
our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
three separate books are used first there is the primary book which
is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
anecdotes second there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
grade generally speaking an expansion of the elementary book by the
addition of forty or fifty thousand words finally there is the high
school manual this too ordinarily follows the beaten path giving
fuller accounts of the same events and characters to put it bluntly we
do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
study of history in the lower grades if mathematicians followed the
same method high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
multiplication table and fractionsthere is of course a ready answer to the criticism advanced above it
is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route no teacher of
history will deny this still it is a standing challenge to existing
methods of historical instruction if the study of history cannot be
made truly progressive like the study of mathematics science and
languages then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
their subject to the already overloaded curriculum if the successive
historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text  more
facts more dates more words  then history deserves most of the sharp
criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science civics and
economicsin this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
new high school text in american history our first contribution is one
of omission the time honored stories of exploration and the
biographies of heroes are left out we frankly hold that if pupils know
little or nothing about columbus cortes magellan or captain john
smith by the time they reach the high school it is useless to tell the
same stories for perhaps the fourth time it is worse than useless it
is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
demonstrated to be progressive in characterin the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles our
reasons for this are simple the strategy of a campaign or of a single
battle is a highly technical and usually a highly controversial matter
about which experts differ widely in the field of military and naval
operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices to
dispose of gettysburg or the wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs any one who
compares the ordinary textbook account of a single civil war campaign
with the account given by ropes for instance will ask for no further
comment no youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
warfare the dramatic scene or episode so useful in arousing the
interest of the immature pupil seems out of place in a book that
deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of lifes
serious responsibilitiesit is not upon negative features however that we rest our case it is
rather upon constructive featuresfirst we have written a topical not a narrative history we have
tried to set forth the important aspects problems and movements of
each period bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustrationsecond we have emphasized those historical topics which help to
explain how our nation has come to be what it is to daythird we have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
history especially in relation to the politics of each periodfourth we have treated the causes and results of wars the problems
of financing and sustaining armed forces rather than military strategy
these are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians these
are matters which civilians can understand  matters which they must
understand if they are to play well their part in war and peacefifth by omitting the period of exploration we have been able to
enlarge the treatment of our own time we have given special attention
to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
matter of sound instruction in citizenshipsixth we have borne in mind that america with all her unique
characteristics is a part of a general civilization accordingly we
have given diplomacy foreign affairs world relations and the
reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate placeseventh we have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity the
study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory we
have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis comparison association
reflection and generalization  habits calculated to enlarge as well as
inform the mind we have been at great pains to make our text clear
simple and direct but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
intellects of our readers  to put them upon their mettle most of them
will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
the world will soon expect maturity from them their achievements will
depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone the
effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
information     cab

part i the colonial period
chapter ithe great migration to america
the tide of migration that set in toward the shores of north america
during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
earth the ancient greeks flung out their colonies in every direction
westward as far as gaul across the mediterranean and eastward into
asia minor perhaps to the very confines of india the romans supported
by their armies and their government spread their dominion beyond the
narrow lands of italy until it stretched from the heather of scotland to
the sands of arabia the teutonic tribes from their home beyond the
danube and the rhine poured into the empire of the caesars and made the
beginnings of modern europe of this great sweep of races and empires
the settlement of america was merely a part and it was moreover only
one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples the
institutions and the trade of europe to the very ends of the earthin one vital point it must be noted american colonization differed
from that of the ancients the greeks usually carried with them
affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
altar of the parent city but thousands of the immigrants who came to
america disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
country they established compacts of government for themselves and set
up altars of their own they sought not only new soil to till but also
political and religious liberty for themselves and their children
the agencies of american colonizationit was no light matter for the english to cross three thousand miles of
water and found homes in the american wilderness at the opening of the
seventeenth century ships tools and supplies called for huge outlays
of money stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own
artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
the hazards of the new world soldiers were required for defense and
mariners for the exploration of inland waters leaders of good judgment
adept in managing men had to be discovered altogether such an
enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
assume though in later days after initial tests had been made wealthy
proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account it was
the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
beginning the trading company   english pioneers in exploration found an
instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers which
had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries
such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
society  noblemen merchants and gentlemen  who banded together for a
particular undertaking each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
the profits of the venture it was organized under royal authority it
received its charter its grant of land and its trading privileges from
the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
control the charter named all the persons originally included in the
corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
affairs including the right to admit new members the company was in
fact a little government set up by the king when the members of the
corporation remained in england as in the case of the virginia company
they operated through agents sent to the colony when they came over the
seas themselves and settled in america as in the case of massachusetts
they became the direct government of the country they possessed the
stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor the
chief magistrate illustration john winthrop governor of the massachusetts bay
company four of the thirteen colonies in america owed their origins to the
trading corporation it was the london company created by king james i
in 1606 that laid during the following year the foundations of virginia
at jamestown it was under the auspices of their west india company
chartered in 1621 that the dutch planted the settlements of the new
netherland in the valley of the hudson the founders of massachusetts
were puritan leaders and men of affairs whom king charles i incorporated
in 1629 under the title the governor and company of the massachusetts
bay in new england in this case the law did but incorporate a group
drawn together by religious ties we must be knit together as one man
wrote john winthrop the first puritan governor in america far to the
south on the banks of the delaware river a swedish commercial company
in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement christened new sweden it
was destined to pass under the rule of the dutch and finally under the
rule of william penn as the proprietary colony of delawarein a certain sense georgia may be included among the company
colonies it was however originally conceived by the moving spirit
james oglethorpe as an asylum for poor men especially those imprisoned
for debt to realize this humane purpose he secured from king george
ii in 1732 a royal charter uniting several gentlemen including
himself into one body politic and corporate known as the trustees
for establishing the colony of georgia in america in the structure of
their organization and their methods of government the trustees did not
differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
colonization though their purposes were benevolent their transactions
had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business the religious congregation   a second agency which figured largely in
the settlement of america was the religious brotherhood or
congregation of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
religious faith by one of the strange fortunes of history this
institution founded in the early days of christianity proved to be a
potent force in the origin and growth of self government in a land far
away from galilee and the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul we are told in the acts describing the church at
jerusalem we are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
the lord  by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
care of each others good and of the whole wrote john robinson a
leader among the pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of plymouth in
1620 the mayflower compact so famous in american history was but a
written and signed agreement incorporating the spirit of obedience to
the common good which served as a guide to self government until
plymouth was annexed to massachusetts in 1691 illustration the original grants three other colonies all of which retained their identity until the eve
of the american revolution likewise sprang directly from the
congregations of the faithful rhode island connecticut and new
hampshire mainly offshoots from massachusetts they were founded by
small bodies of men and women united in solemn covenants with the
lord who planted their settlements in the wilderness not until many a
year after roger williams and anne hutchinson conducted their followers
to the narragansett country was rhode island granted a charter of
incorporation 1663 by the crown not until long after the congregation
of thomas hooker from newtown blazed the way into the connecticut river
valley did the king of england give connecticut a charter of its own
1662 and a place among the colonies half a century elapsed before the
towns laid out beyond the merrimac river by emigrants from massachusetts
were formed into the royal province of new hampshire in 1679even when connecticut was chartered the parchment and sealing wax of
the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self government
and obedience to law previously established by the congregations the
towns of hartford windsor and wethersfield had long lived happily
under their fundamental orders drawn up by themselves in 1639 so had
the settlers dwelt peacefully at new haven under their fundamental
articles drafted in the same year the pioneers on the connecticut
shore had no difficulty in agreeing that the scriptures do hold forth a
perfect rule for the direction and government of all men the proprietor   a third and very important colonial agency was the
proprietor or proprietary as the name associated with the word
property implies the proprietor was a person to whom the king
granted property in lands in north america to have hold use and enjoy
for his own benefit and profit with the right to hand the estate down
to his heirs in perpetual succession the proprietor was a rich and
powerful person prepared to furnish or secure the capital collect the
ships supply the stores and assemble the settlers necessary to found
and sustain a plantation beyond the seas sometimes the proprietor
worked alone sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
common undertakingfive colonies maryland pennsylvania new jersey and the carolinas
owe their formal origins though not always their first settlements nor
in most cases their prosperity to the proprietary system maryland
established in 1634 under a catholic nobleman lord baltimore and
blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649 flourished under
the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the american
union new jersey beginning its career under two proprietors berkeley
and carteret in 1664 passed under the direct government of the crown
in 1702 pennsylvania was in a very large measure the product of the
generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor the leader
of the friends william penn to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
whose family it remained until 1776 the two carolinas were first
organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
eight proprietors including lord clarendon but after more than half a
century both became royal provinces governed by the king illustration william penn proprietor of pennsylvania 
the colonial peoples the english   in leadership and origin the thirteen colonies except
new york and delaware were english during the early days of all save
these two the main if not the sole current of immigration was from
england the colonists came from every walk of life they were men
women and children of all sorts and conditions the major portion
were yeomen or small land owners farm laborers and artisans with
them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
their fortunes to the new world scholars came from oxford and
cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach now and then the son of an
english nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
america the people represented every religious faith  members of the
established church of england puritans who had labored to reform that
church separatists baptists and friends who had left it altogether
and catholics who clung to the religion of their fathersnew england was almost purely english during the years between 1629 and
1640 the period of arbitrary stuart government about twenty thousand
puritans emigrated to america settling in the colonies of the far
north although minor additions were made from time to time the greater
portion of the new england people sprang from this original stock
virginia too for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
england alone not until the eve of the revolution did other
nationalities mainly the scotch irish and germans rival the english in
numbersthe populations of later english colonies  the carolinas new york
pennsylvania and georgia  while receiving a steady stream of
immigration from england were constantly augmented by wanderers from
the older settlements new york was invaded by puritans from new england
in such numbers as to cause the anglican clergymen there to lament that
free thinking spreads almost as fast as the church north carolina was
first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from virginia
some of the north carolinians particularly the quakers came all the
way from new england tarrying in virginia only long enough to learn how
little they were wanted in that anglican colony the scotch irish   next to the english in numbers and influence were
the scotch irish presbyterians in belief english in tongue both
religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea their scotch
ancestors in the days of cromwell had settled in the north of ireland
whence the native irish had been driven by the conquerors sword there
the scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
woolen cloth then the blow fell toward the end of the seventeenth
century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
their cloth was forbidden by the english parliament within two decades
twenty thousand scotch irish left ulster alone for america and all
during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy
although no exact record was kept it is reckoned that the scotch irish
and the scotch who came directly from scotland composed one sixth of
the entire american population on the eve of the revolution illustration settlements of german and scotch irish
immigrants these newcomers in america made their homes chiefly in new jersey
pennsylvania maryland virginia and the carolinas coming late upon
the scene they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
already taken up for this reason most of them became frontier people
settling the interior and upland regions there they cleared the land
laid out their small farms and worked as sturdy yeomen on the soil
hardy industrious and independent in spirit sharing neither the
luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
merchants to their agriculture they added woolen and linen
manufactures which flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
women made heavy inroads upon the trade of the english merchants in
the colonies of their labors a poet has sung        o willing hands to toil
    strong natures tuned to the harvest song and bound to the kindly soil
    bold pioneers for the wilderness defenders in the field the germans   third among the colonists in order of numerical
importance were the germans from the very beginning they appeared in
colonial records a number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
jamestown colony were of german descent peter minuit the famous
governor of new motherland was a german from wesel on the rhine and
jacob leisler leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
administration of new york was a german from frankfort on main the
wholesale migration of germans began with the founding of pennsylvania
penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the rhine
country a great association known as the frankfort company bought
more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
center at germantown for the distribution of german immigrants in old
new york rhinebeck on the hudson became a similar center for
distribution all the way from maine to georgia inducements were offered
to the german farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found in
time german settlements in fact the migration became so large that
german princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
england was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
dominions yet nothing could stop the movement by the end of the
colonial period the number of germans had risen to more than two
hundred thousandthe majority of them were protestants from the rhine region and south
germany wars religious controversies oppression and poverty drove
them forth to america though most of them were farmers there were also
among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
industries in pennsylvania their iron glass paper and woolen mills
dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions added to the
wealth and independence of the province illustration from an old printa glimpse of old germantown unlike the scotch irish the germans did not speak the language of the
original colonists or mingle freely with them they kept to themselves
built their own schools founded their own newspapers and published
their own books their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
and led to occasional agitations against foreigners however no
serious collisions seem to have occurred and in the days of the
revolution german soldiers from pennsylvania fought in the patriot
armies side by side with soldiers from the english and scotch irish
sections other nationalities   though the english the scotch irish and the
germans made up the bulk of the colonial population there were other
racial strains as well varying in numerical importance but contributing
their share to colonial lifefrom france came the huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
inflicted terrible penalties upon protestantsfrom old ireland came thousands of native irish celtic in race and
catholic in religion like their scotch irish neighbors to the north
they revered neither the government nor the church of england imposed
upon them by the sword how many came we do not know but shipping
records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
the southern and eastern shores of ireland for the new world
undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were irish of the native
stock this surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
celtic names in the records of various colonies illustrationfrom an old printold dutch fort and english church near albany the jews then as ever engaged in their age long battle for religious
and economic toleration found in the american colonies not complete
liberty but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in england
france spain or portugal the english law did not actually recognize
their right to live in any of the dominions but owing to the easy going
habits of the americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
towns the treatment they received there varied on one occasion the
mayor and council of new york forbade them to sell by retail and on
another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship newport
philadelphia and charleston were more hospitable and there large
jewish colonies consisting principally of merchants and their families
flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the lawthough the small swedish colony in delaware was quickly submerged
beneath the tide of english migration the dutch in new york continued
to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the english
conquest in 1664 at the end of the colonial period over one half of the
170000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
dutch  still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
manners of new york many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their dutch ovens
but they were slowly losing their identity as the english pressed in
beside them to farm and tradethe melting pot had begun its historic mission
the process of colonizationconsidered from one side colonization whatever the motives of the
emigrants was an economic matter it involved the use of capital to pay
for their passage to sustain them on the voyage and to start them on
the way of production under this stern economic necessity puritans
scotch irish germans and all were alike laid immigrants who paid their own way   many of the immigrants to america
in colonial days were capitalists themselves in a small or a large way
and paid their own passage what proportion of the colonists were able
to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture
undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so for we can trace the
family fortunes of many early settlers henry cabot lodge is authority
for the statement that the settlers of new england were drawn from the
country gentlemen small farmers and yeomanry of the mother
country many of the emigrants were men of wealth as the old lists
show and all of them with few exceptions were men of property and
good standing they did not belong to the classes from which emigration
is usually supplied for they all had a stake in the country they left
behind though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
statement is or how applicable to the other colonies no study has as
yet been made to gratify that interest for the present it is an
unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
cost of their own transfer to the new world indentured servants   that at least tens of thousands of immigrants
were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us the great
barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to america was the cost
of the sea voyage to overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
money to immigrants in return for their promise or bond to work for a
term of years to repay the sum advanced this system was called
indentured servitudeit is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
twenty thousand puritans the yeomen the virginia gentlemen and the
huguenots combined all the way down the coast from massachusetts to
georgia were to be found in the fields kitchens and workshops men
women and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
five to seven years in the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
servants was very high the baltimores penns carterets and other
promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
their fields for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
moon hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open
every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land
and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
servants in pennsylvania it was not uncommon to find a master with
fifty bond servants on his estate it has been estimated that two thirds
of all the immigrants into pennsylvania between the opening of the
eighteenth century and the outbreak of the revolution were in bondage
in the other middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large but
it formed a considerable part of the populationthe story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
things in the history of labor bondmen differed from the serfs of the
feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master
they likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
a time limit still they were subject to many special disabilities it
was for instance a common practice to impose on them penalties far
heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense a free
citizen of pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
let off with a fine a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
was whipped at the post and fined as wellthe ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted a
bondman could not marry without his masters consent nor engage in
trade nor refuse work assigned to him for an attempt to escape or
indeed for any infraction of the law the term of service was extended
the condition of white bondmen in virginia according to lodge was
little better than that of slaves loose indentures and harsh laws put
them at the mercy of their masters it would not be unfair to add that
such was their lot in all other colonies their fate depended upon the
temper of their masterscruel as was the system in many ways it gave thousands of people in the
old world a chance to reach the new  an opportunity to wrestle with fate
for freedom and a home of their own when their weary years of servitude
were over if they survived they might obtain land of their own or
settle as free mechanics in the towns for many a bondman the gamble
proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
carried him for thousands on the contrary bondage proved to be a real
avenue to freedom and prosperity some of the best citizens of america
have the blood of indentured servants in their veins the transported  involuntary servitude   in their anxiety to secure
settlers the companies and proprietors having colonies in america
either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men women
and children from the streets of english cities in 1680 it was
officially estimated that ten thousand persons were spirited away to
america many of the victims of the practice were young children for
the traffic in them was highly profitable orphans and dependents were
sometimes disposed of in america by relatives unwilling to support them
in a single year 1627 about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
virginiain this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies and very few
romances parents were separated from their children and husbands from
their wives hundreds of skilled artisans  carpenters smiths and
weavers  utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death a few thus
dragged off to the new world to be sold into servitude for a term of
five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
fortunes in one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
lived to make his way back to england and establish his claim to a
peerageakin to the kidnapped at least in economic position were convicts
deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment the
americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice
indeed they exaggerated its evils for many of the criminals were
only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws a peasant
caught shooting a rabbit on a lords estate or a luckless servant girl
who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals other transported offenders
were political criminals that is persons who criticized or opposed
the government this class included now irish who revolted against
british rule in ireland now cavaliers who championed the king against
the puritan revolutionists puritans in turn dispatched after the
monarchy was restored and scotch and english subjects in general who
joined in political uprisings against the king the african slaves   rivaling in numbers in the course of time the
indentured servants and whites carried to america against their will
were the african negroes brought to america and sold into slavery when
this form of bondage was first introduced into virginia in 1619 it was
looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
of the white population moreover it does not appear that those planters
who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
system of permanent bondage only by a slow process did chattel slavery
take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
supply in 1650 thirty years after the introduction of slavery there
were only three hundred africans in virginiathe great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in old and in
new england finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in africa
they crowded the southern ports with their vessels the english royal
african company sent to america annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
to ten thousand slaves the ship owners of new england were not far
behind their english brethren in pushing this extraordinary trafficas the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
rose and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders
the southern colonies grew alarmed in 1710 virginia sought to curtail
the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave this effort was
futile for the royal governor promptly vetoed it from time to time
similar bills were passed only to meet with royal disapproval south
carolina in 1760 absolutely prohibited importation but the measure
was killed by the british crown as late as 1772 virginia not daunted
by a century of rebuffs sent to george iii a petition in this vein
the importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of africa
hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
present encouragement we have too much reason to fear will endanger
the very existence of your majestys american dominions deeply
impressed with these sentiments we most humbly beseech your majesty to
remove all those restraints on your majestys governors of this colony
which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
pernicious a commerceall such protests were without avail the negro population grew by leaps
and bounds until on the eve of the revolution it amounted to more than
half a million in five states  maryland virginia the two carolinas
and georgia  the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
in number in south carolina they formed almost two thirds of the
population even in the middle colonies of delaware and pennsylvania
about one fifth of the inhabitants were from africa to the north the
proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
on the same legal footing as in the south in new york approximately one
in six and in new england one in fifty were negroes including a few
freedmenthe climate the soil the commerce and the industry of the north were
all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population still slavery
though sectional was a part of the national system of economy northern
ships carried slaves to the southern colonies and the produce of the
plantations to europe if the northern states will consult their
interest they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers said
john rutledge of south carolina in the convention which framed the
constitution of the united states what enriches a part enriches the
whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest

chapter iicolonial agriculture industry and commercethe land and the westward movement
 the significance of land tenure   the way in which land may be
acquired held divided among heirs and bought and sold exercises a
deep influence on the life and culture of a people the feudal and
aristocratic societies of europe were founded on a system of landlordism
which was characterized by two distinct features in the first place
the land was nearly all held in great estates each owned by a single
proprietor in the second place every estate was kept intact under the
law of primogeniture which at the death of a lord transferred all his
landed property to his eldest son this prevented the subdivision of
estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
owning their own land it made a form of tenantry or servitude
inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land it also
enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
political control if land tenure was so significant in europe it was
equally important in the development of america where practically all
the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
livelihood from the soil experiments in common tillage   in the new world with its broad
extent of land awaiting the white mans plow it was impossible to
introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
and tenants that existed across the sea so it happened that almost
every kind of experiment in land tenure from communism to feudalism
was tried in the early days of the jamestown colony the land though
owned by the london company was tilled in common by the settlers no
man had a separate plot of his own the motto of the community was
labor and share alike all were supposed to work in the fields and
receive an equal share of the produce at plymouth the pilgrims
attempted a similar experiment laying out the fields in common and
distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
the workersin both colonies the communistic experiments were failures angry at the
lazy men in jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
meals captain john smith issued a manifesto everyone that gathereth
not every day as much as i do the next day shall be set beyond the
river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve even
this terrible threat did not bring a change in production not until
each man was given a plot of his own to till not until each gathered
the fruits of his own labor did the colony prosper in plymouth where
the communal experiment lasted for five years the results were similar
to those in virginia and the system was given up for one of separate
fields in which every person could set corn for his own particular
some other new england towns refusing to profit by the experience of
their plymouth neighbor also made excursions into common ownership and
labor only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
the land by degrees it was seen that even the lords people could not
carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
practice feudal elements in the colonies  quit rents manors and
plantations   at the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
land tenure found in the proprietary colonies in the seaboard regions
of the south and to some extent in new york the proprietor was in fact
a powerful feudal lord owning land granted to him by royal charter he
could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
large or small lots while he generally kept for himself an estate of
baronial proportions it was impossible for him to manage directly any
considerable part of the land in his dominion consequently he either
sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
condition that they make to him an annual payment in money known as
quit rent in maryland the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
$9000 equal to about $500000 to day in a single year from this
source in pennsylvania the quit rents brought a handsome annual
tribute into the exchequer of the penn family in the royal provinces
the king of england claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
land a sum amounting to $19000 at the time of the revolution the quit
rent  really a feudal payment from freeholders  was thus a material
source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors wherever
it was laid however it proved to be a burden a source of constant
irritation and it became a formidable item in the long list of
grievances which led to the american revolutionsomething still more like the feudal system of the old world appeared in
the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown the
companies or the proprietors in the colony of maryland alone there
were sixty manors of three thousand acres each owned by wealthy men and
tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
tenure in new york also there were many manors of wide extent most of
which originated in the days of the dutch west india company when
extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
settlers the van rensselaer the van cortlandt and the livingston
manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
representative to the provincial legislature the tenants on the new
york manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old european
estates they were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind they
ground their grain at his mill and they were subject to his judicial
power because he held court and meted out justice in some instances
extending to capital punishmentthe manors of new york or maryland were however of slight consequence
as compared with the vast plantations of the southern seaboard  huge
estates far wider in expanse than many a european barony and tilled by
slaves more servile than any feudal tenants it must not be forgotten
that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
america illustration southern plantation mansion  the small freehold   in the upland regions of the south however and
throughout most of the north the drift was against all forms of
servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold that is
the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
family this was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
immigrants for one thing the abundance of land and the scarcity of
labor made it impossible for the companies the proprietors or the
crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates in
many sections particularly in new england the climate the stony soil
the hills and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
moderate compass for another thing the english scotch irish and
german peasants even if they had been tenants in the old world did not
propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the new if they
could not get freeholds they would not settle at all thus they forced
proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
small lots so it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
became the cherished unit of american farmers the people who tilled the
farms were drawn from every quarter of western europe but the freehold
system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in america illustration from an old printa new england farmhouse  social effects of land tenure   land tenure and the process of western
settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
same pursuit  agriculture they had a common tie in that they both
cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
which arise from that occupation their methods and their culture
however differed widelythe southern planter on his broad acres tilled by slaves resembled the
english landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
labored with his own hands in the fields and forests he sold his rice
and tobacco in large amounts directly to english factors who took his
entire crop in exchange for goods and cash his fine clothes
silverware china and cutlery he bought in english markets loving the
ripe old culture of the mother country he often sent his sons to oxford
or cambridge for their education in short he depended very largely for
his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
old world he did not even need market towns in which to buy native
goods for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
were usually gifted slavesthe economic condition of the small farmer was totally different his
crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with english
factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans he needed
local markets and they sprang up to meet the need smiths hatters
weavers wagon makers and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
with the rough products of their native skill the finer goods bought
by the rich planter in england the small farmer ordinarily could not
buy his wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar and
between him and the european market stood the merchant his community
was therefore more self sufficient than the seaboard line of great
plantations it was more isolated more provincial more independent
more american the planter faced the old east the farmer faced the new
west the westward movement   yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
one respect their land hunger was never appeased each had the eye of
an expert for new and fertile soil and so north and south as soon as
a foothold was secured on the atlantic coast the current of migration
set in westward creeping through forests across rivers and over
mountains many of the later immigrants in their search for cheap
lands were compelled to go to the border but in a large part the path
breakers to the west were native americans of the second and third
generations explorers fired by curiosity and the lure of the
mysterious unknown and hunters fur traders and squatters following
their own sweet wills blazed the trail opening paths and sending back
stories of the new regions they traversed then came the regular
settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased sometimes
singly and sometimes in companiesin massachusetts the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
springfield in 1636 and great barrington in 1725 by the opening of the
eighteenth century the pioneers of connecticut had pushed north and west
until their outpost towns adjoined the hudson valley settlements in new
york the inland movement was directed by the hudson river to albany
and from that old dutch center it radiated in every direction
particularly westward through the mohawk valley new jersey was early
filled to its borders the beginnings of the present city of new
brunswick being made in 1681 and those of trenton in 1685 in
pennsylvania as in new york the waterways determined the main lines of
advance pioneers pushing up through the valley of the schuylkill
spread over the fertile lands of berks and lancaster counties laying
out reading in 1748 another current of migration was directed by the
susquehanna and in 1726 the first farmhouse was built on the bank
where harrisburg was later founded along the southern tier of counties
a thin line of settlements stretched westward to pittsburgh reaching
the upper waters of the ohio while the colony was still under the penn
familyin the south the westward march was equally swift the seaboard was
quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
cultivation of tobacco and rice the piedmont plateau lying back from
the coast all the way from maryland to georgia was fed by two streams
of migration one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
other colonies  germans from pennsylvania and scotch irish furnishing
the main supply by 1770 tide water virginia was full to overflowing
and the back country of the blue ridge and the shenandoah was fully
occupied even the mountain valleys  were claimed by sturdy pioneers
before the declaration of independence the oncoming tide of
home seekers had reached the crest of the alleghanies illustration distribution of population 1790 beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured harbingers of an
invasion that was about to break in upon kentucky and tennessee as
early as 1769 that mighty nimrod daniel boone curious to hunt
buffaloes of which he had heard weird reports passed through the
cumberland gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
plow a hint was sufficient singly in pairs and in groups settlers
followed the trail he had blazed a great land corporation the
transylvania company emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
times secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
rents from lands sold to farmers by the outbreak of the revolution
there were several hundred people in the kentucky region like the older
colonists they did not relish quit rents and their opposition wrecked
the transylvania company they even carried their protests into the
continental congress in 1776 for by that time they were our embryo
fourteenth colony
industrial and commercial developmentthough the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming there was
a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits most of the
staple industries of to day not omitting iron and textiles have their
beginnings in colonial times manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
numbers the great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
originated in the days when the king of england was lord of these
dominions illustration domestic industry dipping tallow candles  textile manufacture as a domestic industry   colonial women in
addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering often the heavy labor
of the open field developed in the course of time a national industry
which was almost exclusively their own wool and flax were raised in
abundance in the north and south every farm house says coman the
economic historian was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
serges kerseys and linsey woolseys which served for the common wear
by the close of the seventeenth century new england manufactured cloth
in sufficient quantities to export it to the southern colonies and to
the west indies as the industry developed mills were erected for the
more difficult process of dyeing weaving and fulling but carding and
spinning continued to be done in the home the dutch of new netherland
the swedes of delaware and the scotch irish of the interior were not
one whit behind their yankee neighborsthe importance of this enterprise to british economic life can hardly be
overestimated for many a century the english had employed their fine
woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade and the
government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
protection when the colonies were established both merchants and
statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value
but before long the americans instead of buying cloth especially of
the coarser varieties were making it to sell in the place of
customers here were rivals in the place of helpless reliance upon
english markets here was the germ of economic independenceif british merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
trade observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
to them even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
governor of new york wrote of the industrious americans to his home
government the consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
once not only comfortably but handsomely too without the help of
england they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
in their breasts this will not seem strange when you consider what sort
of people this country is inhabited by the iron industry   almost equally widespread was the art of iron
working  one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
industries lynn massachusetts had a forge and skilled artisans within
fifteen years after the founding of boston the smelting of iron began
at new london and new haven about 1658 in litchfield county
connecticut a few years later at great barrington massachusetts in
1731 and near by at lenox some thirty years after that new jersey had
iron works at shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
colony in 1665 iron forges appeared in the valleys of the delaware and
the susquehanna early in the following century and iron masters then
laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
the great iron centers of the world virginia began iron working in the
year that saw the introduction of slavery although the industry soon
lapsed it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century
governor spotswood was called the tubal cain of the old dominion
because he placed the industry on a firm foundation indeed it seems
that every colony except georgia had its iron foundry nails wire
metallic ware chains anchors bar and pig iron were made in large
quantities and great britain by an act in 1750 encouraged the
colonists to export rough iron to the british islands shipbuilding   of all the specialized industries in the colonies
shipbuilding was the most important the abundance of fir for masts oak
for timbers and boards pitch for tar and turpentine and hemp for rope
made the way of the shipbuilder easy early in the seventeenth century a
ship was built at new amsterdam and by the middle of that century
shipyards were scattered along the new england coast at newburyport
salem new bedford newport providence new london and new haven
yards at albany and poughkeepsie in new york built ships for the trade
of that colony with england and the indies wilmington and philadelphia
soon entered the race and outdistanced new york though unable to equal
the pace set by new england while maryland virginia and south
carolina also built ships southern interest was mainly confined to the
lucrative business of producing ship materials fir cedar hemp and
tar fishing   the greatest single economic resource of new england outside
of agriculture was the fisheries this industry started by hardy
sailors from europe long before the landing of the pilgrims flourished
under the indomitable seamanship of the puritans who labored with the
net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the atlantic look
exclaimed edmund burke in the house of commons at the manner in
which the people of new england have of late carried on the whale
fishery whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of hudsons bay
and daviss straits while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
cold that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
serpent of the south nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both poles we know that whilst
some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
africa others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
the coast of brazil no sea but what is vexed by their fisheries no
climate that is not witness to their toils neither the perseverance of
holland nor the activity of france nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
of english enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
peoplethe influence of the business was widespread a large and lucrative
european trade was built upon it the better quality of the fish caught
for food was sold in the markets of spain portugal and italy or
exchanged for salt lemons and raisins for the american market the
lower grades of fish were carried to the west indies for slave
consumption and in part traded for sugar and molasses which furnished
the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of new england these
activities in turn stimulated shipbuilding steadily enlarging the
demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
shipwrights calkers rope makers and other artisans of the seaport
towns rushed with work they also increased trade with the mother
country for out of the cash collected in the fish markets of europe and
the west indies the colonists paid for english manufactures so an
ever widening circle of american enterprise centered around this single
industry the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit oceanic commerce and american merchants   all through the eighteenth
century the commerce of the american colonies spread in every direction
until it rivaled in the number of people employed the capital engaged
and the profits gleaned the commerce of european nations a modern
historian has said the enterprising merchants of new england developed
a network of trade routes that covered well nigh half the world this
commerce destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
mother country presented broadly speaking two aspectson the one side it involved the export of raw materials and
agricultural produce the southern colonies produced for shipping
tobacco rice tar pitch and pine the middle colonies grain flour
furs lumber and salt pork new england fish flour rum furs shoes
and small articles of manufacture the variety of products was in fact
astounding a sarcastic writer while sneering at the idea of an
american union once remarked of colonial trade what sort of dish will
you make? new england will throw in fish and onions the middle states
flax seed and flour maryland and virginia will add tobacco north
carolina pitch tar and turpentine south carolina rice and indigo
and georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust such an
absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
discordant materials as the thirteen british provinceson the other side american commerce involved the import trade
consisting principally of english and continental manufactures tea and
india goods sugar and molasses brought from the west indies
supplied the flourishing distilleries of massachusetts rhode island
and connecticut the carriage of slaves from africa to the southern
colonies engaged hundreds of new englands sailors and thousands of
pounds of her capitalthe disposition of imported goods in the colonies though in part
controlled by english factors located in america employed also a large
and important body of american merchants like the willings and morrises
of philadelphia the amorys hancocks and faneuils of boston and the
livingstons and lows of new york in their zeal and enterprise they
were worthy rivals of their english competitors so celebrated for
world wide commercial operations though fully aware of the advantages
they enjoyed in british markets and under the protection of the british
navy the american merchants were high spirited and mettlesome ready to
contend with royal officers in order to shield american interests
against outside interference illustration the dutch west india warehouse in new amsterdam
new york city measured against the immense business of modern times colonial commerce
seems perhaps trivial that however is not the test of its
significance it must be considered in relation to the growth of english
colonial trade in its entirety  a relation which can be shown by a few
startling figures the whole export trade of england including that to
the colonies was in 1704 $6509000 on the eve of the american
revolution namely in 1772 english exports to the american colonies
alone amounted to $6024000 in other words almost as much as the
whole foreign business of england two generations before at the first
date colonial trade was but one twelfth of the english export business
at the second date it was considerably more than one third in 1704
pennsylvania bought in english markets goods to the value of $11459 in
1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507909 in short
pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty eight years
amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of england to the
colonies at the opening of the century the american colonies were
indeed a great source of wealth to english merchants intercolonial commerce   although the bad roads of colonial times made
overland transportation difficult and costly the many rivers and
harbors along the coast favored a lively water borne trade among the
colonies the connecticut hudson delaware and susquehanna rivers in
the north and the many smaller rivers in the south made it possible for
goods to be brought from and carried to the interior regions in little
sailing vessels with comparative ease sloops laden with manufactures
domestic and foreign collected at some city like providence new york
or philadelphia skirted the coasts visited small ports and sailed up
the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms
larger ships carried the grain live stock cloth and hardware of new
england to the southern colonies where they were traded for tobacco
leather tar and ship timber from the harbors along the connecticut
shores there were frequent sailings down through long island sound to
maryland virginia and the distant carolinas growth of towns   in connection with this thriving trade and industry
there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
british empire comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
ports as liverpool and bristol the statistical records of that time are
mainly guesses but we know that philadelphia stood first in size among
these towns serving as the port of entry for pennsylvania delaware
and western jersey it had drawn within its borders just before the
revolution about 25000 inhabitants boston was second in rank with
somewhat more than 20000 people new york the commercial capital of
connecticut and old east jersey was slightly smaller than boston but
growing at a steady rate the fourth town in size was charleston south
carolina with about 10000 inhabitants newport in rhode island a
center of rum manufacture and shipping stood fifth with a population
of about 7000 baltimore and norfolk were counted as considerable
towns in the interior hartford in connecticut lancaster and york in
pennsylvania and albany in new york with growing populations and
increasing trade gave prophecy of an urban america away from the
seaboard the other towns were straggling villages williamsburg
virginia for example had about two hundred houses in which dwelt a
dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen inland county
seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse a prison
and one wretched inn to house judges lawyers and litigants during the
sessions of the courtthe leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
proportion to their population they were the centers of wealth for one
thing of the press and political activity for another merchants and
artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
from their commercial operations the towns were also centers for news
gossip religious controversy and political discussion in the market
places the farmers from the countryside learned of british policies and
laws and so mingling with the townsmen were drawn into the main
currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
independence

chapter iiisocial and political progress
colonial life crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil left
scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences there was
little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
schools libraries and museums few there were with time to read long
and widely and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
delight the eye and the mind and yet poor and meager as the
intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison heroic
efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
of mere existence after the first clearings were opened in the forests
those efforts were redoubled and with lengthening years told upon the
thought and spirit of the land the appearance during the struggle with
england of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history
political philosophy and the arts of war government and diplomacy
itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the american
intellect no one not even the most critical can run through the
writings of distinguished americans scattered from massachusetts to
georgia  the adamses ellsworth the morrises the livingstons
hamilton franklin washington madison marshall henry the randolphs
and the pinckneys  without coming to the conclusion that there was
something in american colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
power women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
process of self education and their keen interest in public issues is
evident in many a record like the letters of mrs john adams to her
husband during the revolution the writings of mrs mercy otis warren
the sister of james otis who measured her pen with the british
propagandists and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women
the leadership of the churchesin the intellectual life of america the churches assumed a role of high
importance there were abundant reasons for this in many of the
colonies  maryland pennsylvania and new england  the religious impulse
had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration in all
the colonies the clergy at least in the beginning formed the only
class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit they preached
on sundays and taught school on week days they led in the discussion of
local problems and in the formation of political opinion so much of
which was concerned with the relation between church and state they
wrote books and pamphlets they filled most of the chairs in the
colleges under clerical guidance intellectual and spiritual the
americans received their formal education in several of the provinces
the anglican church was established by law in new england the puritans
were supreme notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
authority in the middle colonies particularly the multiplication of
sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible and in
all of them there was a growing diversity of faith which promised in
time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion the church of england   virginia was the stronghold of the english
system of church and state the anglican faith and worship were
prescribed by law sustained by taxes imposed on all and favored by the
governor the provincial councilors and the richest planters the
established church says lodge was one of the appendages of the
virginia aristocracy they controlled the vestries and the ministers
and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
planter who built and managed it as in england catholics and
protestant dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities only
slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province but when
once they were even covertly tolerated they pressed steadily in until
by the revolution they outnumbered the adherents of the established
orderthe church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
carolinas after 1704 and in georgia after that colony passed directly
under the crown in 1754  this in spite of the fact that the majority of
the inhabitants were dissenters against the protests of the catholics
it was likewise established in maryland in new york too
notwithstanding the resistance of the dutch the established church was
fostered by the provincial officials and the anglicans embracing about
one fifteenth of the population exerted an influence all out of
proportion to their numbersmany factors helped to enhance the power of the english church in the
colonies it was supported by the british government and the official
class sent out to the provinces its bishops and archbishops in england
were appointed by the king and its faith and service were set forth by
acts of parliament having its seat of power in the english monarchy it
could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
america the church always a strong bulwark of the state therefore had
a political role to play here as in england able bishops and far seeing
leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
church in provincial affairs unhappily for their plans they failed to
calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
protestants who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
in the mother country puritanism in new england   if the established faith made for imperial
unity the same could not be said of puritanism the plymouth pilgrims
had cast off all allegiance to the anglican church and established a
separate and independent congregation before they came to america the
puritans essaying at first the task of reformers within the church
soon after their arrival in massachusetts likewise flung off their yoke
of union with the anglicans in each town a separate congregation was
organized the male members choosing the pastor the teachers and the
other officers they also composed the voters in the town meeting where
secular matters were determined the union of church and government was
thus complete and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
enforced by civil authorities but this worked for local autonomy
instead of imperial unitythe clergy became a powerful class dominant through their learning and
their fearful denunciations of the faithless they wrote the books for
the people to read  the famous cotton mather having three hundred and
eighty three books and pamphlets to his credit in cooperation with the
civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the puritan
sabbath  a day of rest that began at six oclock on saturday evening and
lasted until sunset on sunday all work all trading all amusement and
all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours
a thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
was in danger of being banished as a vagabond robert pike a devout
puritan thinking the sun had gone to rest ventured forth on horseback
one sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
him through a rift in the clouds the next day he was brought into court
and fined for his ungodly conduct with persons accused of witchcraft
the puritans were still more ruthless when a mania of persecution swept
over massachusetts in 1692 eighteen people were hanged one was pressed
to death many suffered imprisonment and two died in jailjust about this time however there came a break in the uniformity of
puritan rule the crown and church in england had long looked upon it
with disfavor and in 1684 king charles ii annulled the old charter of
the massachusetts bay company a new document issued seven years later
wrested from the puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king it also
abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members substituting
for it a simple property qualification thus a royal governor and an
official family certain to be episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
sympathies were forced upon massachusetts and members of all religious
denominations if they had the required amount of property were
permitted to take part in elections by this act in the name of the
crown the puritan monopoly was broken down in massachusetts and that
province was brought into line with connecticut rhode island and new
hampshire where property not religious faith was the test for the
suffrage growth of religious toleration   though neither the anglicans of
virginia nor the puritans of massachusetts believed in toleration for
other denominations that principle was strictly applied in rhode
island there under the leadership of roger williams liberty in
matters of conscience was established in the beginning maryland by
granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in jesus
christ opened its gates to all christians and pennsylvania true to
the tenets of the friends gave freedom of conscience to those who
confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal god to be the
creator upholder and ruler of the world by one circumstance or
another the middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
rather than uniformity of opinion dutch protestants huguenots
quakers baptists presbyterians new lights moravians lutherans
catholics and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule if it had
desired to do so there were communities and indeed whole sections where
one or another church prevailed but in no colony was a legislature
steadily controlled by a single group toleration encouraged diversity
and diversity in turn worked for greater tolerationthe government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
economic and political tendencies to draw america away from the english
state presbyterians quakers baptists and puritans had no hierarchy
of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in london
neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
articles of faith local self government in matters ecclesiastical
helped to train them for local self government in matters political the
spirit of independence which led dissenters to revolt in the old world
nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the new world made
them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
authority imposed from without
schools and colleges religion and local schools   one of the first cares of each protestant
denomination was the education of the children in the faith in this
work the bible became the center of interest the english version was
indeed the one book of the people farmers shopkeepers and artisans
whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor found in
the scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct but also a
book of romance travel and history legend and annal says john
richard green war song and psalm state roll and biography the mighty
voices of prophets the parables of evangelists stories of mission
journeys of perils by sea and among the heathen philosophic arguments
apocalyptic visions all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
the most part by any rival learning as a mere literary monument the
english version of the bible remains the noblest example of the english
tongue it was the king james version just from the press that the
pilgrims brought across the sea with themfor the authority of the established church was substituted the
authority of the scriptures the puritans devised a catechism based upon
their interpretation of the bible and very soon after their arrival in
america they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
works and give answers to the religious questions massachusetts was
scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
declared to be compulsory and provision was made for public schools
where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
writing illustration a page from a famous schoolbook

       felix afraid outside of new england the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
with the same favor but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
little schools kept by dames itinerant teachers or local parsons
whether we turn to the life of franklin in the north or washington in
the south we read of tiny schoolhouses where boys and sometimes
girls were taught to read and write where there were no schools
fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
of learning though illiteracy was widespread there is evidence to show
that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
progress all through the eighteenth century religion and higher learning   religious motives entered into the
establishment of colleges as well as local schools harvard founded in
1636 and yale opened in 1718 were intended primarily to train
learned and godly ministers for the puritan churches of new england
to the far north dartmouth chartered in 1769 was designed first as a
mission to the indians and then as a college for the sons of new england
farmers preparing to preach teach or practice law the college of new
jersey organized in 1746 and removed to princeton eleven years later
was sustained by the presbyterians two colleges looked to the
established church as their source of inspiration and support william
and mary founded in virginia in 1693 and kings college now columbia
university chartered by king george ii in 1754 on an appeal from the
new york anglicans alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
republican tendencies of the age two colleges revealed a drift away
from sectarianism brown established in rhode island in 1764 and the
philadelphia academy forerunner of the university of pennsylvania
organized by benjamin franklin reflected the spirit of toleration by
giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
sects it was franklins idea that his college should prepare young men
to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
their country self education in america   important as were these institutions of
learning higher education was by no means confined within their walls
many well to do families sent their sons to oxford or cambridge in
england private tutoring in the home was common in still more families
there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
of adversity and who trained themselves until in every contest of mind
and wit they could vie with the sons of harvard or william and mary or
any other college such for example was benjamin franklin whose
charming autobiography in addition to being an american classic is a
fine record of self education his formal training in the classroom was
limited to a few years at a local school in boston but his
self education continued throughout his life he early manifested a zeal
for reading and devoured he tells us his fathers dry library on
theology bunyans works defoes writings plutarchs lives lockes
on the human understanding and innumerable volumes dealing with
secular subjects his literary style perhaps the best of his time
franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
spectator in a life crowded with labors he found time to read widely
in natural science and to win single handed recognition at the hands of
european savants for his discoveries in electricity by his own efforts
he attained an acquaintance with latin italian french and spanish
thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
for all america at the court of the king of francelesser lights than franklin educated by the same process were found
all over colonial america from this fruitful source of native ability
self educated the american cause drew great strength in the trials of
the revolution
the colonial press the rise of the newspaper   the evolution of american democracy into a
government by public opinion enlightened by the open discussion of
political questions was in no small measure aided by a free press that
too like education was a matter of slow growth a printing press was
brought to massachusetts in 1639 but it was put in charge of an
official censor and limited to the publication of religious works forty
years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared bearing the curious
title public occurrences both foreign and domestic and it had not
been running very long before the government of massachusetts suppressed
it for discussing a political questionpublishing indeed seemed to be a precarious business but in 1704
there came a second venture in journalism the boston news letter
which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
criticizing the authorities still the public interest languished when
franklins brother james began to issue his new england courant
about 1720 his friends sought to dissuade him saying that one
newspaper was enough for america nevertheless he continued it and his
confidence in the future was rewarded in nearly every colony a gazette
or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more benjamin
franklin was able to record in 1771 that america had twenty five
newspapers boston led with five philadelphia had three two in english
and one in german censorship and restraints on the press   the idea of printing
unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church was
however slow in taking form the founders of the american colonies had
never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books
pamphlets broadsides and newspapers when the art of printing was
first discovered the control of publishing was vested in clerical
authorities after the establishment of the state church in england in
the reign of elizabeth censorship of the press became a part of royal
prerogative printing was restricted to oxford cambridge and london
and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
official censor when the puritans were in power the popular party
with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown sought in turn to silence
royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship after the
restoration of the monarchy control of the press was once more placed
in royal hands where it remained until 1695 when parliament by
failing to renew the licensing act did away entirely with the officialcensorship by that time political parties were so powerful and so
active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
published matter became a sheer impossibilityin america likewise some troublesome questions arose in connection
with freedom of the press the puritans of massachusetts were no less
anxious than king charles or the archbishop of london to shut out from
the prying eyes of the people all literature not mete for them to
read and so they established a system of official licensing for
presses which lasted until 1755 in the other colonies where there was
more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
impunity they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments in 1721 the
editor of the mercury in philadelphia was called before the
proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article
and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail
a still more famous case was that of peter zenger a new york publisher
who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration lawyers who
ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
practice and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
philadelphia by this time the tension of feeling was high and the
approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself not
that of the poor printer was on trial  the verdict for zenger when it
finally came was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing
already the people of king georges province knew how precious a thing
is the freedom of the pressthanks to the schools few and scattered as they were and to the
vigilance of parents a very large portion perhaps nearly one half of
the colonists could read through the newspapers pamphlets and
almanacs that streamed from the types the people could follow the
course of public events and grasp the significance of political
arguments an american opinion was in the process of making  an
independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
around the fireside and at the taverns when the day of resistance to
british rule came government by opinion was at hand for every person
who could hear the voice of patrick henry and samuel adams there were a
thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page men who had
spelled out their letters while poring over franklins poor richards
almanac lived to read thomas paines thrilling call to arms
the evolution in political institutionstwo very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics
the one exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges was the
drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
england the other leading toward democracy and self government was
the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly each
movement gave impetus to the other with increasing force during the
passing years until at last the final collision between the two ideals
of government came in the war of independence the royal provinces   of the thirteen english colonies eight were
royal provinces in 1776 with governors appointed by the king virginia
passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624 when the charter of
the london company was annulled the massachusetts bay corporation lost
its charter in 1684 and the new instrument granted seven years later
stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive in
the early decades of the eighteenth century both the carolinas were
given the provincial instead of the proprietary form new hampshire
severed from massachusetts in 1679 and georgia surrendered by the
trustees in 1752 went into the hands of the crown new york
transferred to the duke of york on its capture from the dutch in 1664
became a province when he took the title of james ii in 1685 new
jersey after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors was
brought directly under the king in 1702 maryland pennsylvania and
delaware although they retained their proprietary character until the
revolution were in some respects like the royal colonies for their
governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
of king george only two colonies rhode island and connecticut
retained full self government on the eve of the revolution they alone
had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosingthe chief officer of the royal province was the governor who enjoyed
high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
turn he enforced the laws and usually with the consent of a council
appointed the civil and military officers he granted pardons and
reprieves he was head of the highest court he was commander in chief
of the militia he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
time of invasion war and rebellion in all the provinces except
massachusetts he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims
he summoned adjourned and dissolved the popular assembly or the lower
house he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown and
he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable here were in america
all the elements of royal prerogative against which hampden had
protested and cromwell had battled in england illustration the royal governors palace at new berne the colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
office seekers and hunters for land grants some of them were noblemen
of broken estates who had come to america to improve their fortunes the
pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves and privileges
granted to them often at the expense of colonists did much to deepen
popular antipathy to the british government favors extended to
adherents of the established church displeased dissenters the
reappearance of this formidable union of church and state from which
they had fled stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination the colonial assembly   coincident with the drift toward
administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
tendency namely a steady growth in the practice of self government
the voters of england had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
law making through representatives in parliament and the idea was early
introduced in america virginia was only twelve years old 1619 when
its first representative assembly appeared as the towns of
massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
the corporation to meet at one place the representative idea was
adopted in 1633 the river towns of connecticut formed a representative
system under their fundamental orders of 1639 and the entire colony
was given a royal charter in 1662 generosity as well as practical
considerations induced such proprietors as lord baltimore and william
penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
considerable settlements were made thus by one process or another every
one of the colonies secured a popular assemblyit is true that in the provision for popular elections the suffrage was
finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers with a leaning
toward the freehold qualification in virginia the rural voter had to
be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land if there was no
house on it or twenty five acres with a house twenty five feet square
in massachusetts the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling in
pennsylvania the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
or more of land well seated twelve acres cleared and to other persons
worth at least fifty pounds in lawful moneyrestrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
considerable number of men particularly the mechanics and artisans of
the towns who were by no means content with their position
nevertheless it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
freehold so cheap and abundant was land and in fact a large proportion
of the colonists were land owners thus the assemblies in spite of the
limited suffrage acquired a democratic tonethe popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
in battles with the royal and proprietary governors when called upon by
the executive to make provision for the support of the administration
the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
interest of the taxpayers it made annual not permanent grants of
money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
treasurer to dole it out thus the colonists learned some of the
mysteries of public finance as well as the management of rapacious
officials the legislature also used its power over money grants to
force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed contests between legislatures and governors   as may be imagined many
and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
and the colonial assemblies franklin relates an amusing story of how
the pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
sign and in the other hand the money to pay his salary then with sly
humor franklin adds do not my courteous reader take pet at our
proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
legislation it is a happy country where justice and what was your own
before can be had for ready money it is another addition to the value
of money and of course another spur to industry every land is not so
blessedit must not be thought however that every governor got off as easily
as franklins tale implies on the contrary the legislatures like
caesar fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength if
we may believe contemporary laments the power of the crown in america
was diminishing when it was struck down altogether in new york the
friends of the governor complained in 1747 that the inhabitants of
plantations are generally educated in republican principles upon
republican principles all is conducted little more than a shadow of
royal authority remains in the northern colonies here echoed the
governor of south carolina the following year levelling principles
prevail the frame of the civil government is unhinged a governor if
he would be idolized must betray his trust the people have got their
whole administration in their hands the election of the members of the
assembly is by ballot not civil posts only but all ecclesiastical
preferments are in the disposal or election of the peoplethough baffled by the levelling principles of the colonial assemblies
the governors did not give up the case as hopeless instead they evolved
a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
obstinate provincials to terms that system traceable in their letters
to the government in london consisted of three parts 1 the royal
officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
by taxes imposed by acts of parliament 2 a british standing army was
to be maintained in america 3 the remaining colonial charters were to
be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlargedsuch a system seemed plausible enough to king george iii and to many
ministers of the crown in london with governors courts and an army
independent of the colonists they imagined it would be easy to carry
out both royal orders and acts of parliament this reasoning seemed both
practical and logical nor was it founded on theory for it came fresh
from the governors themselves it was wanting in one respect only it
failed to take account of the fact that the american people were growing
strong in the practice of self government and could dispense with the
tutelage of the british ministry no matter how excellent it might be or
how benevolent its intentions

chapter ivthe development of colonial nationalism
it is one of the well known facts of history that a people loosely
united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature even a
people torn by domestic strife may be welded into a solid and compact
body by an attack from a foreign power the imperative call to common
defense the habit of sharing common burdens the fusing force of common
service  these things induced by the necessity of resisting outside
interference act as an amalgam drawing together all elements except
perhaps the most discordant the presence of the enemy allays the most
virulent of quarrels temporarily at least politics runs an old
saying stops at the waters edgethis ancient political principle so well understood in diplomatic
circles applied nearly as well to the original thirteen american
colonies as to the countries of europe the necessity for common
defense if not equally great was certainly always pressing though it
has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
in a wilderness this was not actually the case from the earliest
days of jamestown on through the years the american people were
confronted by dangers from without all about their tiny settlements
were indians growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions to the south and
west was the power of spain humiliated it is true by the disaster to
the armada but still presenting an imposing front to the british
empire to the north and west were the french ambitious energetic
imperial in temper and prepared to contest on land and water the
advance of british dominion in america
relations with the indians and the french indian affairs   it is difficult to make general statements about the
relations of the colonists to the indians the problem was presented in
different shape in different sections of america it was not handled
according to any coherent or uniform plan by the british government
which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time neither
did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another in an
irregular train have the consistent policy or the matured experience
necessary for dealing wisely with indian matters as the difficulties
arose mainly on the frontiers where the restless and pushing pioneers
were making their way with gun and ax nearly everything that happened
was the result of chance rather than of calculation a personal quarrel
between traders and an indian a jug of whisky a keg of gunpowder the
exchange of guns for furs personal treachery or a flash of bad temper
often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible characteron one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records  of
squanto and samoset teaching the pilgrims the ways of the wilds of
roger williams buying his lands from the friendly natives or of william
penn treating with them on his arrival in america on the other side of
the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
frontier rolled westward with deadly precision the pequots on the
connecticut border sensing their doom fell upon the tiny settlements
with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment a
generation later king philip son of massasoit the friend of the
pilgrims called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
the strength of all new england to the field and ended in his own
destruction in new york the relations with the indians especially
with the algonquins and the mohawks were marked by periodic and
desperate wars virginia and her southern neighbors suffered as did new
england in 1622 opecacano a brother of powhatan the friend of the
jamestown settlers launched a general massacre and in 1644 he
attempted a war of extermination in 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze
nathaniel bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
an adequate defense and failing in that plea himself headed a revolt
and a successful expedition against the indians as the virginia
outposts advanced into the kentucky country the strife with the natives
was transferred to that dark and bloody ground while to the
southeast a desperate struggle with the tuscaroras called forth the
combined forces of the two carolinas and virginia illustration from an old printvirginians defending themselves against the indians from such horrors new jersey and delaware were saved on account of their
geographical location pennsylvania consistently following a policy of
conciliation was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
full conflict with the allied french and indians georgia by clever
negotiations and treaties of alliance managed to keep on fair terms
with her belligerent cherokees and creeks but neither diplomacy nor
generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced
especially after the french soldiers enlisted the indians in their
imperial enterprises it was then that desultory fighting became general
warfare illustration english french and spanish possessions in america
1750  early relations with the french   during the first decades of french
exploration and settlement in the st lawrence country the english
colonies engrossed with their own problems gave little or no thought
to their distant neighbors quebec founded in 1608 and montreal in
1642 were too far away too small in population and too slight in
strength to be much of a menace to boston hartford or new york it was
the statesmen in france and england rather than the colonists in
america who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
empires in north america it was the ambition of louis xiv of france
rather than the labors of jesuit missionaries and french rangers that
sounded the first note of colonial alarmevidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
english and the french occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
the pennsylvania border king williams war 1689 1697 queen annes
war 1701 1713 and king georges war 1744 1748 owed their origins
and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of european
powers although they all involved the american colonies in struggles
with the french and their savage allies the clash in the ohio valley   the second of these wars had hardly
closed however before the english colonists themselves began to be
seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding french dominion in the
west marquette and joliet who opened the lake region and la salle
who in 1682 had gone down the mississippi to the gulf had been followed
by the builders of forts in 1718 the french founded new orleans thus
taking possession of the gateway to the mississippi as well as the st
lawrence a few years later they built fort niagara in 1731 they
occupied crown point in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
over all the territory drained by the ohio river having asserted this
lofty claim they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
1752 1754 fort le boeuf near lake erie fort venango on the upper
waters of the allegheny and fort duquesne at the junction of the
streams forming the ohio though they were warned by george washington
in the name of the governor of virginia to keep out of territory so
notoriously known to be property of the crown of great britain the
french showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions illustration from an old printbraddocks retreat  the final phase  the french and indian war   thus it happened that the
shot which opened the seven years war known in america as the french
and indian war was fired in the wilds of pennsylvania there began the
conflict that spread to europe and even asia and finally involved
england and prussia on the one side and france austria spain and
minor powers on the other on american soil the defeat of braddock in
1755 and wolfes exploit in capturing quebec four years later were the
dramatic features on the continent of europe england subsidized
prussian arms to hold france at bay in india on the banks of the
ganges as on the banks of the st lawrence british arms were
triumphant well could the historian write conquests equaling in
rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of cortes and pizarro had
been achieved in the east well could the merchants of london declare
that under the administration of william pitt the imperial genius of
this world wide conflict commerce had been united with and made to
flourish by warfrom the point of view of the british empire the results of the war
were momentous by the peace of 1763 canada and the territory east of
the mississippi except new orleans passed under the british flag the
remainder of the louisiana territory was transferred to spain and french
imperial ambitions on the american continent were laid to rest in
exchange for havana which the british had seized during the war spain
ceded to king george the colony of florida not without warrant did
macaulay write in after years that pitt was the first englishman of his
time and he had made england the first country in the world
the effects of warfare on the coloniesthe various wars with the french and the indians trivial in detail as
they seem to day had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
destiny of america circumstances beyond the control of popular
assemblies jealous of their individual powers compelled cooperation
among them grudging and stingy no doubt but still cooperation the
american people more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
trades were simply forced to raise and support armies to learn the
arts of warfare and to practice if in a small theater the science of
statecraft these forces all cumulative drove the colonists so
tenaciously provincial in their habits in the direction of nationalism the new england confederation   it was in their efforts to deal with
the problems presented by the indian and french menace that the
americans took the first steps toward union though there were many
common ties among the settlers of new england it required a deadly
fear of the indians to produce in 1643 the new england confederation
composed of massachusetts plymouth connecticut and new haven the
colonies so united were bound together in a firm and perpetual league
of friendship and amity for offense and defense mutual service and
succor upon all just occasions they made provision for distributing
the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies for
some twenty years the confederation was active and it continued to hold
meetings until after the extinction of the indian peril on the immediate
bordervirginia no less than massachusetts was aware of the importance of
intercolonial cooperation in the middle of the seventeenth century the
old dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with new york and the
colonies of new england in 1684 delegates from virginia met at albany
with the agents of new york and massachusetts to discuss problems of
mutual defense a few years later the old dominion cooperated loyally
with the carolinas in defending their borders against indian forays the albany plan of union   an attempt at a general colonial union was
made in 1754 on the suggestion of the lords of trade in england a
conference was held at albany to consider indian relations to devise
measures of defense against the french and to enter into articles of
union and confederation for the general defense of his majestys
subjects and interests in north america as well in time of peace as of
war new hampshire massachusetts connecticut rhode island new york
pennsylvania and maryland were represented after a long discussion a
plan of union drafted mainly it seems by benjamin franklin was
adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval the
colonies jealous of their individual rights refused to accept the
scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason franklin said that
it had too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution
though the albany union failed the document is still worthy of study
because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
until thirty three years afterward when another convention of which
also franklin was a member drafted the constitution of the united
states illustration benjamin franklin  the military education of the colonists   the same wars that showed
the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
of defending their institutions particularly was this true of the last
french and indian conflict which stretched all the way from maine to
the carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops the answer
it is admitted was far from satisfactory to the british government and
the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional but thousands
of americans got a taste a strong taste of actual fighting in the
field men like george washington and daniel morgan learned lessons that
were not forgotten in after years they saw what american militiamen
could do under favorable circumstances and they watched british regulars
operating on american soil this whole transaction shrewdly remarked
franklin of braddocks campaign gave us americans the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regular troops had not
been well founded it was no mere accident that the virginia colonel
who drew his sword under the elm at cambridge and took command of the
army of the revolution was the brave officer who had spurned the
whistle of bullets at the memorable battle in western pennsylvania financial burdens and commercial disorder   while the provincials were
learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills all the
conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood king philips war left
new england weak and almost bankrupt the french and indian struggle was
especially expensive the twenty five thousand men put in the field by
the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money paper
currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated commerce
was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced when the
end came both england and america were staggering under heavy
liabilities and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
ten years it was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
had to be devised to pay the cost of the war precipitating the quarrel
which led to american independence the expulsion of french power from north america   the effects of the
defeat administered to france as time proved were difficult to
estimate some british statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
that the colonists already restive under their administration had no
foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence
american leaders on the other hand now that the soldiers of king louis
were driven from the continent thought that they had no other country
to fear if they cast off british sovereignty at all events france
though defeated was not out of the sphere of american influence for
as events proved it was the fortunate french alliance negotiated by
franklin that assured the triumph of american arms in the war of the
revolution
colonial relations with the british governmentit was neither the indian wars nor the french wars that finally brought
forth american nationality that was the product of the long strife
with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
independence the forces that created this nation did not operate in the
colonies alone the character of the english sovereigns the course of
events in english domestic politics and english measures of control
over the colonies  executive legislative and judicial  must all be
taken into account the last of the stuarts   the struggles between charles i 1625 49
and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the puritan regime
1649 60 so engrossed the attention of englishmen at home that they had
little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
affairs the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 accompanied by
internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
house of commons changed all that in the reign of charles ii
1660 85 himself an easy going person the policy of regulating trade
by act of parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created at the same
time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
the annulment of the old charter of massachusetts which conferred so
much self government on the puritanscharles successor james ii a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
authority in the colonies as well as at home continued the policy thus
inaugurated and enlarged upon it if he could have kept his throne he
would have bent the americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688
he determined to unite the northern colonies and introduce a more
efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces he
made a martinet sir edmund andros governor of all new england new
york and new jersey the charter of massachusetts annulled in the last
days of his brothers reign he continued to ignore and that of
connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
hidden according to tradition in a hollow oakfor several months andros gave the northern colonies a taste of
ill tempered despotism he wrung quit rents from land owners not
accustomed to feudal dues he abrogated titles to land where in his
opinion they were unlawful he forced the episcopal service upon the
old south church in boston and he denied the writ of habeas corpus to
a preacher who denounced taxation without representation in the middle
of his arbitrary course however his hand was stayed the news came
that king james had been dethroned by his angry subjects and the people
of boston kindling a fire on beacon hill summoned the countryside to
dispose of andros the response was prompt and hearty the hated
governor was arrested imprisoned and sent back across the sea under
guardthe overthrow of james followed by the accession of william and mary
and by assured parliamentary supremacy had an immediate effect in the
colonies the new order was greeted with thanksgiving massachusetts was
given another charter which though not so liberal as the first
restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self government in the
other colonies where andros had been operating the old course of
affairs was resumed the indifference of the first two georges   on the death in 1714 of
queen anne the successor of king william the throne passed to a
hanoverian prince who though grateful for english honors and revenues
was more interested in hanover than in england george i and george ii
whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760 never even learned to
speak the english language at least without an accent the necessity of
taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
stoutest defender of popular privileges in boston or charleston had no
ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king
moreover during a large part of this period the direction of affairs
was in the hands of an astute leader sir robert walpole who betrayed
his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto let
sleeping dogs lie he revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
by exclaiming i will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
expense of blood such kings and such ministers were not likely to
arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
sea control of the crown over the colonies   while no english ruler from
james ii to george iii ventured to interfere with colonial matters
personally constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
officers acting under the authority of the crown systematic supervision
began in 1660 when there was created by royal order a committee of the
kings council to meet on mondays and thursdays of each week to consider
petitions memorials and addresses respecting the plantations in 1696
a regular board was established known as the lords of trade and
plantations which continued until the american revolution to
scrutinize closely colonial business the chief duties of the board were
to examine acts of colonial legislatures to recommend measures to those
assemblies for adoption and to hear memorials and petitions from the
colonies relative to their affairsthe methods employed by this board were varied all laws passed by
american legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine
if it found an act unsatisfactory it recommended to the king the
exercise of his veto power known as the royal disallowance any person
who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
could be heard by the board in person or by attorney in such cases it
was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
involved the royal veto power over colonial legislation was not
therefore a formal affair but was constantly employed on the
suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown all this was in
addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
provinces judicial control   supplementing this administrative control over the
colonies was a constant supervision by the english courts of law the
king by virtue of his inherent authority claimed and exercised high
appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire the right
of appeal from local courts expressly set forth in some charters was
on the eve of the revolution maintained in every colony any subject in
england or america who in the regular legal course was aggrieved by
any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court
had the right subject to certain regulations to carry his case to the
king in council forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea in
the exercise of appellate power the king in council acting as a court
could and frequently did declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
enacted and approved null and void on the ground that they were
contrary to english law imperial control in operation   day after day week after week year
after year the machinery for political and judicial control over
colonial affairs was in operation at one time the british governors in
the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
duty on european goods imported in english vessels again when north
carolina laid a tax on peddlers the council objected to it as
restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of english manufactures
throughout the continent at other times indian trade was regulated in
the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
legislature were set aside virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
north carolina lest there should be retaliationin short foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
higher than that of the colony foreshadowing a day when the
constitution of the united states was to commit to congress the power to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the indians
a superior judicial power towering above that of the colonies as the
supreme court at washington now towers above the states kept the
colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law in
the thousands of appeals memorials petitions and complaints and the
rulings and decisions upon them were written the real history of
british imperial control over the american coloniesso great was the business before the lords of trade that the colonies
had to keep skilled agents in london to protect their interests as
common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
arose there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men with
the merchants in the lead who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
enterprise only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism when to the
repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
parliament applying to every colony the rebound came in the revolution parliamentary control over colonial affairs   as soon as parliament
gained in power at the expense of the king it reached out to bring the
american colonies under its sway as well between the execution of
charles i and the accession of george iii there was enacted an immense
body of legislation regulating the shipping trade and manufactures of
america all of it based on the mercantile theory then prevalent in
all countries of europe was designed to control the overseas
plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
interests of the mother country where merchants and men of finance had
got the upper hand according to this theory the colonies of the
british empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
raw materials and forced to buy their manufactured goods of englandthe navigation acts  in the first rank among these measures of
british colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
the purpose of building up the british merchant marine and navy  arms so
essential in defending the colonies against the spanish dutch and
french the beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
it was worked out into a system early in the reign of charles ii
1660 85the navigation acts in effect gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
british ships no trade could be carried on between great britain and
her dominions save in vessels built and manned by british subjects no
european goods could be brought to america save in the ships of the
country that produced them or in english ships these laws which were
almost fatal to dutch shipping in america fell with severity upon the
colonists compelling them to pay higher freight rates the adverse
effect however was short lived for the measures stimulated
shipbuilding in the colonies where the abundance of raw materials gave
the master builders of america an advantage over those of the mother
country thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
policy written into the navigation actsthe acts against manufactures  the second group of laws was
deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
sharply with those of england among the earliest of these measures may
be counted the woolen act of 1699 forbidding the exportation of woolen
goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
colonies when parliament learned as the result of an inquiry that new
england and new york were making thousands of hats a year and sending
large numbers annually to the southern colonies and to ireland spain
and portugal it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that no hats or felts
dyed or undyed finished or unfinished should be put upon any vessel
or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
whatever the effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
ruinous a few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
industry by an act of 1750 pig and bar iron from the colonies were
given free entry to england to encourage the production of the raw
material but at the same time the law provided that no mill or other
engine for slitting or rolling of iron no plating forge to work with a
tilt hammer and no furnace for making steel should be built in the
colonies as for those already built they were declared public
nuisances and ordered closed thus three important economic interests of
the colonists the woolen hat and iron industries were laid under the
banthe trade laws  the third group of restrictive measures passed by the
british parliament related to the sale of colonial produce an act of
1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to great britain
or to her dominions alone while sugar tobacco and ginger consigned to
the continent of europe had to pass through a british port paying custom
duties and through a british merchants hands paying the usual
commission at first tobacco was the only one of the enumerated
articles which seriously concerned the american colonies the rest
coming mainly from the british west indies in the course of time
however other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
articles until by 1764 it embraced rice naval stores copper furs
hides iron lumber and pearl ashes this was not all the colonies
were compelled to bring their european purchases back through english
ports paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
againthe molasses act  not content with laws enacted in the interest of
english merchants and manufacturers parliament sought to protect the
british west indies against competition from their french and dutch
neighbors new england merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
with the french islands in the west indies and dutch guiana where sugar
and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices acting
on the protests of english planters in the barbadoes and jamaica
parliament in 1733 passed the famous molasses act imposing duties on
sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
countries  rates which would have destroyed the american trade with the
french and dutch if the law had been enforced the duties however were
not collected the molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
merrily smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic effect of the laws in america   as compared with the strict monopoly
of her colonial trade which spain consistently sought to maintain the
policy of england was both moderate and liberal furthermore the
restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
favorable to colonial prosperity the navigation acts for example
redounded to the advantage of american shipbuilders and the producers
of hemp tar lumber and ship stores in general favors in british
ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
and in some instances bounties were paid by england to encourage
colonial enterprise taken all in all there is much justification in
the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
colonists gained more than they lost by british trade and industrial
legislation certainly after the establishment of independence when
free from these old restrictions the americans found themselves
handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
and the recipients of bounties in english marketsbe that as it may it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
enacted previous to the close of the french and indian war relatively
few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
in farming and planting so that englands policy of restricting america
to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
the inhabitants the woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
and carried on in connection with their domestic duties so that it was
not the sole support of any considerable number of peopleas a matter of fact moreover the restrictive laws especially those
relating to trade were not rigidly enforced cargoes of tobacco were
boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
english government to which duties should have been paid sugar and
molasses from the french and dutch colonies were shipped into new
england in spite of the law royal officers sometimes protested against
smuggling and sometimes connived at it but at no time did they succeed
in stopping it taken all in all very little was heard of the galling
restraints of trade until after the french war when the british
government suddenly entered upon a new course
summary of the colonial periodin the period between the landing of the english at jamestown virginia
in 1607 and the close of the french and indian war in 1763  a period of
a century and a half  a new nation was being prepared on this continent
to take its place among the powers of the earth it was an epoch of
migration western europe contributed emigrants of many races and
nationalities the english led the way next to them in numerical
importance were the scotch irish and the germans into the melting pot
were also cast dutch swedes french jews welsh and irish thousands
of negroes were brought from africa to till southern fields or labor as
domestic servants in the northwhy did they come? the reasons are various some of them the pilgrims
and puritans of new england the french huguenots scotch irish and
irish and the catholics of maryland fled from intolerant governments
that denied them the right to worship god according to the dictates of
their consciences thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
the old world and to find free homes in america thousands like the
negroes from africa were dragged here against their will the lure of
adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
enterprising merchantshow did they come? in some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way in other
cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies again it
was the wealthy proprietor like lord baltimore or william penn who
undertook to plant settlements many immigrants were able to pay their
own way across the sea others bound themselves out for a term of years
in exchange for the cost of the passage negroes were brought on account
of the profits derived from their sale as slaveswhatever the motive for their coming however they managed to get
across the sea the immigrants set to work with a will they cut down
forests built houses and laid out fields they founded churches
schools and colleges they set up forges and workshops they spun and
wove they fashioned ships and sailed the seas they bartered and
traded here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
commerce  boston providence new york philadelphia baltimore and
charleston as soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
they pressed westward until by the close of the colonial period they
were already on the crest of the alleghaniesthough they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast
the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties the major
portion of them were protestants the language the law and the
literature of england furnished the basis of national unity most of the
colonists were engaged in the same hard task that of conquering a
wilderness to ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
necessity they had to unite in defense first against the indians and
later against the french they were all subjects of the same
sovereign  the king of england the english parliament made laws for
them and the english government supervised their local affairs their
trade and their manufactures common forces assailed them common
grievances vexed them common hopes inspired themmany of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
them into opposition to the british crown and parliament most of them
were freeholders that is farmers who owned their own land and tilled
it with their own hands a free soil nourished the spirit of freedom
the majority of them were dissenters critics not friends of the
church of england that stanch defender of the british monarchy each
colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters it
grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself here was a
people learning self reliance and self government the attempts to
strengthen the church of england in america and the transformation of
colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
which they were designed to quenchnevertheless the americans owed much of their prosperity to the
assistance of the government that irritated them it was the protection
of the british navy that prevented holland spain and france from
wiping out their settlements though their manufacture and trade were
controlled in the interests of the mother country they also enjoyed
great advantages in her markets free trade existed nowhere upon the
earth but the broad empire of britain was open to american ships and
merchandise it could be said with good reason that the disadvantages
which the colonists suffered through british regulation of their
industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed
still that is somewhat beside the point for mere economic advantage is
not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples a
thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation
to inspire it with a passion for independence and to prepare it for a
destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the british
empire the economists who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
america would be richer under the british flag could not change the
spirit of patrick henry samuel adams benjamin franklin or george

chapter vthe new course in british imperial policy
on october 25 1760 king george ii died and the british crown passed to
his young grandson the first george the son of the elector of hanover
and sophia the granddaughter of james i was a thorough german who never
even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned
the second george never saw england until he was a man he spoke english
with an accent and until his death preferred his german home during
their reign the principle had become well established that the king did
not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
parliament
george iii and his system the character of the new king   the third george rudely broke the
german tradition of his family he resented the imputation that he was a
foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his british sympathies
to the draft of his first speech to parliament he added the popular
phrase born and educated in this country i glory in the name of
briton macaulay the english historian certainly of no liking for
high royal prerogative said of george the young king was a born
englishman all his tastes and habits good and bad were english no
portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with his age
his appearance and all that was known of his character conciliated
public favor he was in the bloom of youth his person and address were
pleasing scandal imputed to him no vice and flattery might without
glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtuesnevertheless george iii had been spoiled by his mother his tutors and
his courtiers under their influence he developed high and mighty
notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
the pretensions of parliament and the ministers dependent upon it his
mother had dinned into his ears the slogan george be king  lord
bute his teacher and adviser had told him that his honor required him
to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
laws thus educated he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
him in the determination to rule as well as reign to subdue all
parties and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire illustration from an old printgeorge iii  political parties and george iii   the state of the political parties
favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
the crown the whigs who were composed mainly of the smaller
freeholders merchants inhabitants of towns and protestant
non conformists had grown haughty and overbearing through long
continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
their own ranks their opponents the tories had by this time given up
all hope of restoring to the throne the direct stuart line but they
still cherished their old notions about divine right with the
accession of george iii the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
around the throne again george received his tory friends with open
arms gave them offices and bought them seats in the house of commons the british parliamentary system   the peculiarities of the british
parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
with their designs for controlling the entire government in the first
place the house of lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites as
of old though the members of the house of commons were elected by
popular vote they did not speak for the mass of english people great
towns like leeds manchester and birmingham for example had no
representatives at all while there were about eight million inhabitants
in great britain there were in 1768 only about 160000 voters that is
to say only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
government many boroughs returned one or more members to the commons
although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
voters at all furthermore these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder
the rotten boroughs as they were called by reformers were a public
scandal but george iii readily made use of them to get his friends into
the house of commons
george iiis ministers and their colonial policies grenville and the war debt   within a year after the accession of
george iii william pitt was turned out of office the king treating him
with gross incivility and the crowds shouting pitt forever  the
direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the kings
confidence leadership in the house of commons fell to george grenville
a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
cost of governmentthe first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
of the disordered finances of the kingdom the debt stood at the highest
point in the history of the country more revenue was absolutely
necessary and grenville began to search for it turning his attention
finally to the american colonies in this quest he had the aid of a
zealous colleague charles townshend who had long been in public
service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
governors in america these two men with the support of the entire
ministry inaugurated in february 1763 a new system of colonial
government it was announced by authority that there were to be no more
requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies but
that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of parliament
colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the crown they were to
be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments and all the
expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation restriction of paper money 1763   among the many complaints filed
before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
paper money by the colonial legislatures the new ministry provided a
remedy in the act of 1763 which declared void all colonial laws
authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills this
law was aimed at the cheap money which the americans were fond of
making when specie was scarce  money which they tried to force on their
english creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
principal of debts thus the first chapter was written in the long
battle over sound money on this continent limitation on western land sales   later in the same year 1763
george iii issued a royal proclamation providing among other things
for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
paris from the french one of the provisions in this royal decree
touched frontiersmen to the quick the contests between the kings
officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
been long and sharp the americans chafed at restrictions on
settlement the more adventurous were continually moving west and
squatting on land purchased from the indians or simply seized without
authority to put an end to this the king forbade all further purchases
from the indians reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
and dispose of them for settlement a second provision in the same
proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the indians
including the lucrative fur business in the hands of royal officers in
the colonies these two limitations on american freedom and enterprise
were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
preservation of the rights of the indians against fraud and abuses the sugar act of 1764   king georges ministers next turned their
attention to measures of taxation and trade since the heavy debt under
which england was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
america nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
upon the english taxpayer the sugar act of 1764 was the result of this
reasoning there was no doubt about the purpose of this law for it was
set forth clearly in the title an act for granting certain duties in
the british colonies and plantations in america  for applying the
produce of such duties  towards defraying the expenses of defending
protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations  and for
more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
trade between the same and great britain the old molasses act had been
prohibitive the sugar act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
measure specified duties were laid upon sugar indigo calico silks
and many other commodities imported into the colonies the enforcement
of the molasses act had been utterly neglected but this sugar act had
teeth in it special precautions as to bonds security and
registration of ship masters accompanied by heavy penalties promised
a vigorous execution of the new revenue lawthe strict terms of the sugar act were strengthened by administrative
measures under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
vessels stationed along the american coast were authorized to stop
search and on suspicion seize merchant ships approaching colonial
ports by supplementary orders the entire british official force in
america was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
navigation laws revenue collectors officers of the army and navy and
royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
in the matter of law enforcement the ordinary motives for the discharge
of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice for
naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties the stamp act 1765   the grenville townshend combination moved
steadily towards its goal while the sugar act was under consideration
in parliament grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill the next
year it went through both houses with a speed that must have astounded
its authors the vote in the commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against
while in the lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
of a count as george iii was temporarily insane the measure received
royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency protests of
colonial agents in london were futile we might as well have hindered
the suns progress  exclaimed franklin protests of a few opponents in
the commons were equally vain the ministry was firm in its course and
from all appearances the stamp act hardly roused as much as a languid
interest in the city of london in fact it is recorded that the fateful
measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
act for the king when he was incapacitatedthe stamp act like the sugar act declared the purpose of the british
government to raise revenue in america towards defraying the expenses
of defending protecting and securing the british colonies and
plantations in america it was a long measure of more than fifty
sections carefully planned and skillfully drawn by its provisions
duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
transactions  deeds mortgages inventories writs bail bonds  on
licenses to practice law and sell liquor on college diplomas playing
cards dice pamphlets newspapers almanacs calendars and
advertisements the drag net was closely knit for scarcely anything
escaped the quartering act 1765   the ministers were aware that the stamp
act would rouse opposition in america  how great they could not
conjecture while the measure was being debated a friend of general
wolfe colonel barre who knew america well gave them an ominous
warning in the commons believe me  remember i this day told you so  
he exclaimed the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
first will accompany them still  a people jealous of their liberties
and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated the
answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force
preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
soldiers than usual to the colonies and the ink was hardly dry on the
stamp act when parliament passed the quartering act ordering the
colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
the new laws we have the power to tax them said one of the ministry
and we will tax them
colonial resistance forces repeal popular opposition   the stamp act was greeted in america by an
outburst of denunciation the merchants of the seaboard cities took the
lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest agreeing not to
import british goods while the hated law stood upon the books lawyers
some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
papers joined with the merchants aristocratic colonial whigs who had
long grumbled at the administration of royal governors protested
against taxation without their consent as the whigs had done in old
england there were tories however in the colonies as in england  many
of them of the official class  who denounced the merchants lawyers and
whig aristocrats as seditious factious and republican yet the
opposition to the stamp act and its accompanying measure the quartering
act grew steadily all through the summer of 1765in a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
countryside all through the north and in some of the southern colonies
there sprang up as if by magic committees and societies pledged to
resist the stamp act to the bitter end these popular societies were
known as sons of liberty and daughters of liberty the former including
artisans mechanics and laborers and the latter patriotic women both
groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
affairs many artisans as well as all the women were excluded from the
right to vote for colonial assemblymenwhile the merchants and whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
drafting well phrased protests against british measures the sons of
liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures they stirred
up riots in boston new york philadelphia and charleston when attempts
were made to sell the stamps they sacked and burned the residences of
high royal officers they organized committees of inquisition who by
threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of british goods and the use
of stamped papers in fact the sons of liberty carried their operations
to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
unloosed the daughters of liberty in a quieter way were making a very
effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
domestic industries their own particular province being the manufacture
of clothing and devising substitutes for taxed foods they helped to
feed and clothe their families without buying british goods legislative action against the stamp act   leaders in the colonial
assemblies accustomed to battle against british policies supported the
popular protest the stamp act was signed on march 22 1765 on may 30
the virginia house of burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
that the general assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
illegal unconstitutional and unjust it was in support of these
resolutions that patrick henry uttered the immortal challenge caesar
had his brutus charles i his cromwell and george iii cries of
treason were calmly met by the orator who finished george iii may
profit by their example if that be treason make the most of it illustration patrick henry  the stamp act congress   the massachusetts assembly answered the call
of virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a congress to
be held in new york to discuss the situation nine colonies responded
and sent representatives the delegates while professing the warmest
affection for the kings person and government firmly spread on record
a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning they
declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent given
through their respective colonial assemblies that the stamp act showed
a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties that the recent trade
acts were burdensome and grievous and that the right to petition the
king and parliament was their heritage they thereupon made humble
supplication for the repeal of the stamp actthe stamp act congress was more than an assembly of protest it marked
the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of america
it was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
government of george iii in the colonies it foreshadowed the congress
of the united states under the constitution it was a successful attempt
at union there ought to be no new england men declared christopher
gadsden in the stamp act congress no new yorkers known on the
continent but all of us americans the repeal of the stamp act and the sugar act   the effect of american
resistance on opinion in england was telling commerce with the colonies
had been effectively boycotted by the americans ships lay idly swinging
at the wharves bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in london
bristol and liverpool workingmen in the manufacturing towns of england
were thrown out of employment the government had sown folly and was
reaping in place of the coveted revenue rebellionperplexed by the storm they had raised the ministers summoned to the
bar of the house of commons benjamin franklin the agent for
pennsylvania who was in london do you think it right asked
grenville that america should be protected by this country and pay no
part of the expenses? the answer was brief that is not the case the
colonies raised clothed and paid during the last war twenty five
thousand men and spent many millions then came an inquiry whether the
colonists would accept a modified stamp act no never replied
franklin never  they will never submit to it  it was next suggested
that military force might compel obedience to law franklin had a ready
answer they cannot force a man to take stamps they may not find a
rebellion they may indeed make onethe repeal of the stamp act was moved in the house of commons a few days
later the sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted debts
due british merchants placed in jeopardy manchester industries closed
workingmen unemployed oppression instituted and the loss of the
colonies threatened pitt and edmund burke the former near the close
of his career the latter just beginning his argued cogently in favor
of retracing the steps taken the year before grenville refused
america must learn he wailed that prayers are not to be brought to
caesar through riot and sedition his protests were idle the commons
agreed to the repeal on february 22 1766 amid the cheers of the
victorious majority it was carried through the lords in the face of
strong opposition and on march 18 reluctantly signed by the king now
restored to his right mindin rescinding the stamp act parliament did not admit the contention of
the americans that it was without power to tax them on the contrary it
accompanied the repeal with a declaratory act it announced that the
colonies were subordinate to the crown and parliament of great britain
that the king and parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever and that the
resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
null and voidthe repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
demonstrations bells were rung toasts to the king were drunk and
trade resumed its normal course the declaratory act as a mere paper
resolution did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
the name of king george their confidence was soon strengthened by the
news that even the sugar act had been repealed thus practically
restoring the condition of affairs before grenville and townshend
inaugurated their policy of thoroughness
resumption of british revenue and commercial policies the townshend acts 1767   the triumph of the colonists was brief
though pitt the friend of america was once more prime minister and
seated in the house of lords as the earl of chatham his severe illness
gave to townshend and the tory party practical control over parliament
unconvinced by the experience with the stamp act townshend brought
forward and pushed through both houses of parliament three measures
which to this day are associated with his name first among his
restrictive laws was that of june 29 1767 which placed the enforcement
of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
in the hands of british commissioners appointed by the king resident in
the colonies paid from the british treasury and independent of all
control by the colonists the second measure of the same date imposed a
tax on lead glass paint tea and a few other articles imported into
the colonies the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
officials a third measure was the tea act of july 2 1767 aimed at the
tea trade which the americans carried on illegally with foreigners this
law abolished the duty which the east india company had to pay in
england on tea exported to america for it was thought that english tea
merchants might thus find it possible to undersell american tea
smugglers writs of assistance legalized by parliament   had parliament been
content with laying duties just as a manifestation of power and right
and neglected their collection perhaps little would have been heard of
the townshend acts it provided however for the strict even the
harsh enforcement of the law it ordered customs officers to remain at
their posts and put an end to smuggling in the revenue act of june 29
1767 it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
issue writs of assistance empowering customs officers to enter any
house warehouse shop cellar or other place in the british colonies
or plantations in america to search for and seize prohibited or
smuggled goodsthe writ of assistance which was a general search warrant issued to
revenue officers was an ancient device hateful to a people who
cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
gains in the practice of civil liberty to allow a minion of the law
to enter a mans house and search his papers and premises was too much
for the emotions of people who had fled to america in a quest for
self government and free homes who had braved such hardships to
establish them and who wanted to trade without official interferencethe writ of assistance had been used in massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
illicit trade with canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
time in 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
massachusetts court for writs of assistance as usual this application
was vainly opposed by james otis in a speech of five hours duration  a
speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
away ready to take up arms against writs of assistance otis denounced
the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
his head and another his throne a tyrants device which placed the
liberty of every man in jeopardy enabling any petty officer to work
possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion and to
spread terror and desolation through the land what a scene he
exclaimed does this open  every man prompted by revenge ill humor
or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbors house may get a
writ of assistance others will ask it from self defense one arbitrary
exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
blood he did more than attack the writ itself he said that parliament
could not establish it because it was against the british constitution
this was an assertion resting on slender foundation but it was quickly
echoed by the people then and there james otis sounded the call to
america to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers
then and there wrote john adams the child independence was born
such was the hated writ that townshend proposed to put into the hands of
customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law the new york assembly suspended   in the very month that townshends
acts were signed by the king parliament took a still more drastic step
the assembly of new york protesting against the ruinous and
insupportable expense involved had failed to make provision for the
care of british troops in accordance with the terms of the quartering
act parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
obey the law it was not until a third election was held that compliance
with the quartering act was wrung from the reluctant province in the
meantime all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
representative bodies rested
renewed resistance in america the massachusetts circular 1768   massachusetts under the
leadership of samuel adams resolved to resist the policy of renewed
intervention in america at his suggestion the assembly adopted a
circular letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
informing them of the state of affairs in massachusetts and roundly
condemning the whole british program the circular letter declared that
parliament had no right to lay taxes on americans without their consent
and that the colonists could not from the nature of the case be
represented in parliament it went on shrewdly to submit to
consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
paid out of funds raised independently it invited the other colonies
in the most temperate tones to take thought about the common
predicament in which they were all placed illustration from an old printsamuel adams  the dissolution of assemblies   the governor of massachusetts hearing
of the circular letter ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal on
meeting refusal he promptly dissolved it the maryland georgia and
south carolina assemblies indorsed the circular letter and were also
dissolved at once the virginia house of burgesses thoroughly aroused
passed resolutions on may 16 1769 declaring that the sole right of
imposing taxes in virginia was vested in its legislature asserting anew
the right of petition to the crown condemning the transportation of
persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas and beseeching the
king for a redress of the general grievances the immediate dissolution
of the virginia assembly in its turn was the answer of the royal
governor the boston massacre   american opposition to the british authorities
kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved the houses of
citizens searched and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
the centers of discontent merchants again agreed not to import british
goods the sons of liberty renewed their agitation and women set about
the patronage of home products still more loyallyon the night of march 5 1770 a crowd on the streets of boston began to
jostle and tease some british regulars stationed in the town things
went from bad to worse until some boys and young fellows began to
throw snowballs and stones then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
crowd killing five and wounding half a dozen more the day after the
massacre a mass meeting was held in the town and samuel adams was
sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers the governor hesitated
and tried to compromise finding adams relentless the governor yielded
and ordered the regulars awaythe boston massacre stirred the country from new hampshire to georgia
popular passions ran high the guilty soldiers were charged with murder
their defense was undertaken in spite of the wrath of the populace by
john adams and josiah quincy who as lawyers thought even the worstoffenders entitled to their full rights in law in his speech to the
jury however adams warned the british government against its course
saying that from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one two of
the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished resistance in the south   the year following the boston massacre some
citizens of north carolina goaded by the conduct of the royal governor
openly resisted his authority many were killed as a result and seven
who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors a little later royal
troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near alamance river
called the lexington of the south the gaspee affair and the virginia resolutions of 1773   on sea as
well as on land friction between the royal officers and the colonists
broke out into overt acts while patrolling narragansett bay looking for
smugglers one day in 1772 the armed ship gaspee ran ashore and was
caught fast during the night several men from providence boarded the
vessel and after seizing the crew set it on fire a royal commission
sent to rhode island to discover the offenders and bring them to
account failed because it could not find a single informer the very
appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of virginia to
action and in march 1773 the house of burgesses passed a resolution
creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
among the colonies in resistance to british measures the boston tea party   although the british government finding the
townshend revenue act a failure repealed in 1770 all the duties except
that on tea it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies moreover
parliament decided to relieve the british east india company of the
financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
tea act and the colonial boycott that followed in 1773 it agreed to
return to the company the regular import duties levied in england on
all tea transshipped to america a small impost of three pence to be
collected in america was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
in the declaratory act that parliament had the right to tax the
coloniststhis arrangement with the east india company was obnoxious to the
colonists for several reasons it was an act of favoritism for one
thing in the interest of a great monopoly for another thing it
promised to dump on the american market suddenly an immense amount of
cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to american merchants who had large
stocks on hand it threatened with ruin the business of all those who
were engaged in clandestine trade with the dutch it carried with it an
irritating tax of three pence on imports in charleston annapolis new
york and boston captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
roughly handled one night in december 1773 a band of boston citizens
disguised as indians boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
into the harbor this was serious business for it was open flagrant
determined violation of the law as such the british government viewed
it
retaliation by the british government reception of the news of the tea riot   the news of the tea riot in
boston confirmed king george in his conviction that there should be no
soft policy in dealing with his american subjects the die is cast he
stated with evident satisfaction the colonies must either triumph or
submit if we take the resolute part they will undoubtedly be very
meek lord george germain characterized the tea party as the
proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought if they had
the least prudence to follow their mercantile employments and not
trouble themselves with politics and government which they do not
understand this expressed in concise form exactly the sentiments of
lord north who had then for three years been the kings chief minister
even pitt lord chatham was prepared to support the government in
upholding its authority the five intolerable acts   parliament beginning on march 31 1774
passed five stringent measures known in american history as the five
intolerable acts they were aimed at curing the unrest in america the
first of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of boston to
commerce with the outside world the second following closely
revoked the massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
the councilors should be appointed by the king that all judges should
be named by the royal governor and that town meetings except to elect
certain officers could not be held without the governors consent a
third measure after denouncing the utter subversion of all lawful
government in the provinces authorized royal agents to transfer to
great britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law
the fourth act legalized the quartering of troops in massachusetts
towns the fifth of the measures was the quebec act which granted
religious toleration to the catholics in canada extended the boundaries
of quebec southward to the ohio river and established in this western
region government by a viceroythe intolerable acts went through parliament with extraordinary
celerity there was an opposition alert and informed but it was
ineffective burke spoke eloquently against the boston port bill
condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty and
showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train he
was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected the bill passed both
houses without a division the entry unanimous being made upon their
journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion
the law destroying the charter of massachusetts passed the commons by a
vote of three to one and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
one the triumph of the ministry was complete what passed in boston
exclaimed the great jurist lord mansfield is the overt act of high
treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight the
crown and parliament were united in resorting to punitive measuresin the colonies the laws were received with consternation to the
american protestants the quebec act was the most offensive that
project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
attempt to enlist french canadians on the side of great britain the
british government did not grant religious toleration to catholics
either at home or in ireland and the americans could see no good motive
in granting it in north america the act was also offensive because
massachusetts connecticut and virginia had under their charters
large claims in the territory thus annexed to quebecto enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the british
government was brought into play the commander in chief of the armed
forces in america general gage was appointed governor of
massachusetts reinforcements were brought to the colonies for now king
george was to give the rebels as he called them a taste of strong
medicine the majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force
from reform to revolution in america the doctrine of natural rights   the dissolution of assemblies the
destruction of charters and the use of troops produced in the colonies
a new phase in the struggle in the early days of the contest with the
british ministry the americans spoke of their rights as englishmen
and condemned the acts of parliament as unlawful as violating the
principles of the english constitution under which they all lived when
they saw that such arguments had no effect on parliament they turned
for support to their natural rights the latter doctrine in the form
in which it was employed by the colonists was as english as the
constitutional argument john locke had used it with good effect in
defense of the english revolution in the seventeenth century american
leaders familiar with the writings of locke also took up his thesis in
the hour of their distress they openly declared that their rights did
not rest after all upon the english constitution or a charter from the
crown old magna carta was not the beginning of all things retorted
otis when the constitutional argument failed a time may come when
parliament shall declare every american charter void but the natural
inherent and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
until the general conflagration of the same opinion was the young and
impetuous alexander hamilton the sacred rights of mankind he
exclaimed are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records they are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
destiny by the hand of divinity itself and can never be erased or
obscured by mortal powerfirm as the american leaders were in the statement and defense of their
rights there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion they constantly
avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
language against his policies even otis regarded by the loyalists as a
firebrand was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
concessions from england i argue this cause with the greater
pleasure he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
assistance as it is in favor of british liberty  and as it is in
opposition to a kind of power the exercise of which in former periods
cost one king of england his head and another his throne burke offers the doctrine of conciliation   the flooding tide of
american sentiment was correctly measured by one englishman at least
edmund burke who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
american democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature he
saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the american
spirit  how inevitable how irresistible he warned his countrymen that
there were three ways of handling the delicate situation  and only
three one was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
the colonists  an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
in the essential circumstances of american life the second was to
prosecute american leaders as criminals of this he begged his
countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that a government
against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
government to which submission is equivalent to slavery the third and
right way to meet the problem burke concluded was to accept the
american spirit repeal the obnoxious measures and receive the colonies
into equal partnership events produce the great decision   the right way indicated by burke
was equally impossible to george iii and the majority in parliament to
their narrow minds american opinion was contemptible and american
resistance unlawful riotous and treasonable the correct way in their
view was to dispatch more troops to crush the rebels and that very
act took the contest from the realm of opinion as john adams said
facts are stubborn things opinions were unseen but marching soldiers
were visible to the veriest street urchin now said gouverneur
morris the sheep simple as they are cannot be gulled as heretofore
it was too late to talk about the excellence of the british
constitution if any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
historians as to why the crisis came at last he can clarify his
understanding by reading again edmund burkes stately oration on
conciliation with america

resistance and retaliation the continental congress   when the news of the intolerable acts
reached america every one knew what strong medicine parliament was
prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority the
cause of massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies opposition
to british policy hitherto local and spasmodic now took on a national
character to local committees and provincial conventions was added a
continental congress appropriately called by massachusetts on june 17
1774 at the instigation of samuel adams the response to the summons
was electric by hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
during the summer and on september 5 the congress duly assembled in
carpenters hall in philadelphia many of the greatest men in america
were there  george washington and patrick henry from virginia and john
and samuel adams from massachusetts every shade of opinion was
represented some were impatient with mild devices the majority favored
moderationthe congress drew up a declaration of american rights and stated in
clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists it
approved the resistance to british measures offered by massachusetts and
promised the united support of all sections it prepared an address to
king george and another to the people of england disavowing the idea of
independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the british
government the non importation agreement   the congress was not content however
with professions of faith and with petitions it took one revolutionary
step it agreed to stop the importation of british goods into america
and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
committees of safety and inspection to be elected by the qualified
voters the significance of this action is obvious congress threw
itself athwart british law it made a rule to bind american citizens and
to be carried into effect by american officers it set up a state within
the british state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order
the colonists who up to this moment had been wavering had to choose
one authority or the other they were for the enforcement of the
non importation agreement or they were against it they either bought
english goods or they did not in the spirit of the toast  may britain
be wise and america be free  the first continental congress adjourned
in october having appointed the tenth of may following for the meeting
of a second congress should necessity require lord norths olive branch   when the news of the action of the
american congress reached england pitt and burke warmly urged a repeal
of the obnoxious laws but in vain all they could wring from the prime
minister lord north was a set of conciliatory resolutions proposing
to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
the crown this olive branch was accompanied by a resolution assuring
the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
the restraining act of march 30 1775 which in effect destroyed the
commerce of new england bloodshed at lexington and concord april 19 1775   meanwhile the
british authorities in massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
upholding british sovereignty general gage hearing that military
stores had been collected at concord dispatched a small force to seize
them by this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid
at lexington on the road to concord occurred the little thing that
produced the great event an unexpected collision beyond the thought
or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
battle field the second continental congress   though blood had been shed and war
was actually at hand the second continental congress which met at
philadelphia in may 1775 was not yet convinced that conciliation was
beyond human power it petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
war on the last day of july it made a temperate but firm answer to
lord norths offer of conciliation stating that the proposal was
unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
the offensive acts of parliament force the british answer   just as the representatives of america
were about to present the last petition of congress to the king on
august 23 1775 george iii issued a proclamation of rebellion this
announcement declared that the colonists misled by dangerous and
ill designing men were in a state of insurrection it called on the
civil and military powers to bring the traitors to justice and it
threatened with condign punishment the authors perpetrators and
abettors of such traitorous designs it closed with the usual prayer
god save the king later in the year parliament passed a sweeping
act destroying all trade and intercourse with america congress was
silent at last force was also americas answer
american independence drifting into war   although the congress had not given up all hope of
reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775 it had firmly resolved
to defend american rights by arms if necessary it transformed the
militiamen who had assembled near boston after the battle of lexington
into a continental army and selected washington as commander in chief
it assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money wage
war and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries illustration from an old printspirit of 1776 events followed thick and fast on june 17 the american militia by
the stubborn defense of bunker hill showed that it could make british
regulars pay dearly for all they got on july 3 washington took command
of the army at cambridge in january 1776 after bitter disappointments
in drumming up recruits for its army in england scotland and ireland
the british government concluded a treaty with the landgrave of
hesse cassel in germany contracting at a handsome figure for thousands
of soldiers and many pieces of cannon this was the crowning insult to
america such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
of the water such was long afterward the judgment of the conservative
historian lecky the conduct of england in hiring german mercenaries to
subdue the essentially english population beyond the atlantic made
reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable the news of this
wretched transaction in german soldiers had hardly reached america
before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that washington
had taken boston on march 17 1776 compelling lord howe to sail with
his entire army for halifax the growth of public sentiment in favor of independence   events were
bearing the americans away from their old position under the british
constitution toward a final separation slowly and against their
desires prudent and honorable men who cherished the ties that united
them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
revolution were drawn into the path that led to the great decision in
all parts of the country and among all classes the question of the hour
was being debated american independence as the historian bancroft
says was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
assembly it had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
and merchants by mechanics and planters by the fishermen along the
coast and the backwoodsmen of the west in town meetings and from the
pulpit at social gatherings and around the camp fires in county
conventions and conferences or committees in colonial congresses and
assemblies illustration from an old printthomas paine  paines commonsense   in the midst of this ferment of american
opinion a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
public with a program for absolute independence without fears and
without apologies in the early days of 1776 thomas paine issued the
first of his famous tracts commonsense a passionate attack upon the
british monarchy and an equally passionate plea for american liberty
casting aside the language of petition with which americans had hitherto
addressed george iii paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
with many a violent epithet he condemned monarchy itself as a system
which had laid the world in blood and ashes instead of praising the
british constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
rights he brushed it aside as ridiculous protesting that it was owing
to the constitution of the people not to the constitution of the
government that the crown is not as oppressive in england as in
turkeyhaving thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
order paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
separation from great britain there was nothing in the sphere of
practical interest he insisted which should bind the colonies to the
mother country allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
in which they had been involved reasons of trade were not less weighty
in behalf of independence our corn will fetch its price in any market
in europe and our imported goods must be paid for buy them where we
will as to matters of government it is not in the power of britain
to do this continent justice the business of it will soon be too
weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of usthere is accordingly no alternative to independence for america
everything that is right or natural pleads for separation the blood of
the slain the weeping voice of nature cries tis time to part 
arms the last resort must decide the contest the appeal was the
choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge the
sun never shone on a cause of greater worth tis not the affair of a
city a county a province or a kingdom but of a continent tis not
the concern of a day a year or an age posterity is involved in the
contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
proceedings now now is the seed time of continental union faith and
honor o  ye that love mankind  ye that dare oppose not only the
tyranny but the tyrant stand forth let names of whig and tory be
extinct let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen
an open and resolute friend and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
mankind and of the free and independent states of america as more than
100000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country patriots
exclaimed with washington sound doctrine and unanswerable reason  the drift of events toward independence   official support for the
idea of independence began to come from many quarters on the tenth of
february 1776 gadsden in the provincial convention of south carolina
advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
for all america the convention balked at the latter but went half way
by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
complete plan of self government a month later on april 12 the
neighboring state of north carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
others shrank it empowered its representatives in the congress to
concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
independence rhode island massachusetts and virginia quickly
responded to the challenge the convention of the old dominion on may
15 instructed its delegates at philadelphia to propose the independence
of the united colonies and to give the assent of virginia to the act of
separation when the resolution was carried the british flag on the
state house was lowered for all timemeanwhile the continental congress was alive to the course of events
outside the subject of independence was constantly being raised are
we rebels? exclaimed wyeth of virginia during a debate in february
no we must declare ourselves a free people others hesitated and
spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation is
not america already independent? asked samuel adams a few weeks later
why not then declare it? still there was uncertainty and delegates
avoided the direct word a few more weeks elapsed at last on may 10
congress declared that the authority of the british crown in america
must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
their own illustration from an old printthomas jefferson reading his draft of the declaration of
independence to the committee of congress  independence declared   the way was fully prepared therefore when
on june 7 the virginia delegation in the congress moved that these
united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
states a committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
document setting forth the reasons for the act and on july 2 all the
states save new york went on record in favor of severing their political
connection with great britain two days later july 4 jeffersons draft
of the declaration of independence changed in some slight particulars
was adopted the old bell in independence hall as it is now known rang
out the glad tidings couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
hamlet and farm a new nation announced its will to have a place among
the powers of the worldto some documents is given immortality the declaration of independence
is one of them american patriotism is forever associated with it but
patriotism alone does not make it immortal neither does the vigor of
its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
the records of time the secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
throughout the earth challenging kings and potentates shaking down
thrones and aristocracies breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
battle fields as far apart as marston moor and chateau thierry that
ideal now so familiar then so novel is summed up in the simple
sentence governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governedwritten in a decent respect for the opinions of mankind to set forth
the causes which impelled the american colonists to separate from
britain the declaration contained a long list of abuses and
usurpations which had induced them to throw off the government of king
george that section of the declaration has passed into ancient
history and is seldom read it is the part laying down a new basis for
government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
household phrase in the old world as in the newin the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which
from the standpoint of the old system of government were the essence of
revolution 1 all men are created equal and are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights including life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness 2 the purpose of government is to secure these
rights 3 governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed 4 whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
institute new government laying its foundations on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness here was the prelude to the historic
drama of democracy  a challenge to every form of government and every
privilege not founded on popular assent
the establishment of government and the new allegiance the committees of correspondence   as soon as debate had passed into
armed resistance the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
forces by organizing civil government this was readily effected for
the means were at hand in town meetings provincial legislatures and
committees of correspondence the working tools of the revolution were
in fact the committees of correspondence  small local unofficial
groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment
as early as november 1772 such a committee had been created in boston
under the leadership of samuel adams it held regular meetings sent
emissaries to neighboring towns and carried on a campaign of education
in the doctrines of liberty illustration the colonies of north america at the time of the
declaration of independence upon local organizations similar in character to the boston committee
were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees
congresses and conventions all unofficial and representing the
revolutionary elements ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
controlled by patriots finally upon these colonial assemblies was
built the continental congress the precursor of union under the
articles of confederation and ultimately under the constitution of the
united states this was the revolutionary government set up within the
british empire in america state constitutions framed   with the rise of these new assemblies of
the people the old colonial governments broke down from the royal
provinces the governor the judges and the high officers fled in haste
and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities the appeal to
the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
themselves issued by the congress in may 1776 was quickly acted upon
before the expiration of a year virginia new jersey pennsylvania
delaware maryland georgia and new york had drafted new constitutions
as states not as colonies uncertain of their destinies connecticut and
rhode island holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
needs merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
before so far as the form of government was concerned south carolina
which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776 drew up a new and more
complete constitution in 1778 two years later massachusetts with much
deliberation put into force its fundamental law which in most of its
essential features remains unchanged to daythe new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
models for the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
chosen usually by the legislature but in two instances new york and
massachusetts by popular vote for the provincial council there was
substituted except in georgia a senate while the lower house or
assembly was continued virtually without change the old property
restriction on the suffrage though lowered slightly in some states was
continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
deprived of the ballot the special qualifications laid down in several
constitutions for governors senators and representatives indicated
that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
experiments in democracy the protests of a few women like mrs john
adams of massachusetts and mrs henry corbin of virginia against a
government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
mild curiosities of no significance although in new jersey women were
allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as menby the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power of
authority derived from any source save the people were swept aside
and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
time to the modern world copies of these remarkable documents prepared
by plain citizens were translated into french and widely circulated in
europe there they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
a generation of constitution makers whose mission it was to begin the
democratic revolution in the old world the articles of confederation   the formation of state constitutions
was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders they had only to build
on foundations already laid the establishment of a national system of
government was another matter there had always been it must be
remembered a system of central control over the colonies but americans
had had little experience in its operation when the supervision of the
crown of great britain was suddenly broken the patriot leaders
accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship were poorly trained for
action on a national stagemany forces worked against those who like franklin had a vision of
national destiny there were differences in economic interest  commerce
and industry in the north and the planting system of the south there
were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
for common defense to these practical difficulties were added local
pride the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
provincial dignity and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
the common enterprisenevertheless necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
federation the second continental congress had hardly opened its work
before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
permanent connection as early as july 1775 congress resolved to go
into a committee of the whole on the state of the union and franklin
undaunted by the fate of his albany plan of twenty years before again
presented a draft of a constitution long and desultory debates followed
and it was not until late in 1777 that congress presented to the states
the articles of confederation provincial jealousies delayed
ratification and it was the spring of 1781 a few months before the
surrender of cornwallis at yorktown when maryland the last of the
states approved the articles this plan of union though it was all
that could be wrung from the reluctant states provided for neither a
chief executive nor a system of federal courts it created simply a
congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
government  money and soldiers the application of tests of allegiance   as the successive steps were
taken in the direction of independent government the patriots devised
and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
the new nation in the process of making when the first continental
congress agreed not to allow the importation of british goods it
provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules such
agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme all
opponents being excluded from the elections before these bodies those
who persisted in buying british goods were summoned and warned or
punished according to circumstances as soon as the new state
constitutions were put into effect local committees set to work in the
same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
the new order of things illustration mobbing the tories these patriot agencies bearing different names in different sections
were sometimes ruthless in their methods they called upon all men to
sign the test of loyalty frequently known as the association test
those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws while some of the
more dangerous were thrown into jail the prison camp in connecticut at
one time held the former governor of new jersey and the mayor of new
york thousands were black listed and subjected to espionage the
black list of pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
persons of prominence who were under suspicion loyalists or tories who
were bold enough to speak and write against the revolution were
suppressed and their pamphlets burned in many places particularly in
the north the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
proceeds applied to the cause of the revolutionthe work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
sometimes supplemented by mob violence a few tories were hanged without
trial and others were tarred and feathered one was placed upon a cake
of ice and held there until his loyalty to king george might cool
whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
they could within the british lines or into canada where the british
government gave them lands such excesses were deplored by washington
but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war as well
as a war for independence was being waged the patriots and tories   thus by one process or another those who
were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
preferred to be subjects of king george just what proportion of the
americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
british monarchy there is no way of knowing the question of revolution
was not submitted to popular vote and on the point of numbers we have
conflicting evidence on the patriot side there is the testimony of a
careful and informed observer john adams who asserted that two thirds
of the people were for the american cause and not more than one third
opposed the revolution at all stageson behalf of the loyalists or tories as they were popularly known
extravagant claims were made joseph galloway who had been a member of
the first continental congress and had fled to england when he saw its
temper testified before a committee of parliament in 1779 that not
one fifth of the american people supported the insurrection and that
many more than four fifths of the people prefer a union with great
britain upon constitutional principles to independence at the same
time general robertson who had lived in america twenty four years
declared that more than two thirds of the people would prefer the
kings government to the congress tyranny in an address to the king
in that year a committee of american loyalists asserted that the number
of americans in his majestys army exceeded the number of troops
enlisted by congress to oppose them the character of the loyalists   when general howe evacuated boston
more than a thousand people fled with him this great company according
to a careful historian formed the aristocracy of the province by
virtue of their official rank of their dignified callings and
professions of their hereditary wealth and of their culture the act
of banishment passed by massachusetts in 1778 listing over 300 tories
reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
new england more than one out of five being graduates of harvard
college the same was true of new york and philadelphia namely that
the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order
clergymen and wealthy merchants with passion the loyalists fought
against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
for a life of uncertainty in canada or the mother country tories assail the patriots   the tories who remained in america joined
the british army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
cause those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
editorials rhymes satires and political catechisms they declared
that the members of congress were obscure pettifogging attorneys
bankrupt shopkeepers outlawed smugglers etc the people and their
leaders they characterized as wretched banditti  the refuse and
dregs of mankind the generals in the army they sneered at as men of
rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the congress patriot writers arouse the national spirit   stung by tory taunts
patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
opinion favorable to the american cause moreover they had to combat
the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
war a terrible disaster befell generals arnold and montgomery in the
winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring canada into the revolution  a
disaster that cost 5000 men repeated calamities harassed washington in
1776 as he was defeated on long island driven out of new york city and
beaten at harlem heights and white plains these reverses were almost
too great for the stoutest patriotspamphleteers preachers and publicists rose however to meet the needs
of the hour john witherspoon provost of the college of new jersey
forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy the poet
philip freneau flung taunts of cowardice at the tories and celebrated
the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem songs ballads plays
and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream fast days
battle anniversaries celebrations of important steps taken by congress
afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons
does mr wiberd preach against oppression? anxiously inquired john
adams in a letter to his wife the answer was decisive the clergy of
every denomination not excepting the episcopalian thunder and lighten
every sabbath they pray for boston and massachusetts they thank god
most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes they pray
for the american armythomas paine never let his pen rest he had been with the forces of
washington when they retreated from fort lee and were harried from new
jersey into pennsylvania he knew the effect of such reverses on the
army as well as on the public in december 1776 he made a second great
appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet the crisis the first part
of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him this
tract was a cry for continued support of the revolution these are the
times that try mens souls he opened the summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his
country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
and women paine laid his lash fiercely on the tories branding every
one as a coward grounded in servile slavish self interested fear he
deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army he
refuted the charge that the retreat through new jersey was a disaster
and he promised victory soon by perseverance and fortitude he
concluded we have the prospect of a glorious issue by cowardice and
submission the sad choice of a variety of evils  a ravaged country a
depopulated city habitations without safety and slavery without
hope look on this picture and weep over it his ringing call to
arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
over
military affairs the two phases of the war   the war which opened with the battle of
lexington on april 19 1775 and closed with the surrender of
cornwallis at yorktown on october 19 1781 passed through two distinct
phases  the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with france in
1778 and the second until the end of the struggle during the first
phase the war was confined mainly to the north the outstanding
features of the contest were the evacuation of boston by the british
the expulsion of american forces from new york and their retreat through
new jersey the battle of trenton the seizure of philadelphia by the
british september 1777 the invasion of new york by burgoyne and his
capture at saratoga in october 1777 and the encampment of american
forces at valley forge for the terrible winter of 1777 78the final phase of the war opening with the treaty of alliance with
france on february 6 1778 was confined mainly to the middle states
the west and the south in the first sphere of action the chief events
were the withdrawal of the british from philadelphia the battle of
monmouth and the inclosure of the british in new york by deploying
american forces from morristown new jersey up to west point in the
west george rogers clark by his famous march into the illinois
country secured kaskaskia and vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
country between the ohio and the great lakes in the south the second
period opened with successes for the british they captured savannah
conquered georgia and restored the royal governor in 1780 they seized
charleston administered a crushing defeat to the american forces under
gates at camden and overran south carolina though meeting reverses at
cowpens and kings mountain then came the closing scenes cornwallis
began the last of his operations he pursued general greene far into
north carolina clashed with him at guilford court house retired to the
coast took charge of british forces engaged in plundering virginia and
fortified yorktown where he was penned up by the french fleet from the
sea and the combined french and american forces on land the geographical aspects of the war   for the british the theater of
the war offered many problems from first to last it extended from
massachusetts to georgia a distance of almost a thousand miles it was
nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and though
the british navy kept the channel open transports were constantly
falling prey to daring privateers and fleet american war vessels the
sea on the other hand offered an easy means of transportation between
points along the coast and gave ready access to the american centers of
wealth and population of this the british made good use though early
forced to give up boston they seized new york and kept it until the end
of the war they took philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
the approach of the french fleet and they captured and held both
savannah and charleston wars however are seldom won by the conquest
of citiesparticularly was this true in the case of the revolution only a small
portion of the american people lived in towns countrymen back from the
coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood they lived on
the produce of the soil not upon the profits of trade this very fact
gave strength to them in the contest whenever the british ventured far
from the ports of entry they encountered reverses burgoyne was forced
to surrender at saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
base of supplies as soon as the british got away from charleston they
were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of marion sumter
and pickens cornwallis could technically defeat greene at guilford far
in the interior but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded
sustained by their own labor possessing the interior to which their
armies could readily retreat supplied mainly from native resources the
americans could not be hemmed in penned up and destroyed at one fell
blow the sea power   the british made good use of their fleet in cutting
off american trade but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
united states as an agricultural country the ruin of its commerce was
not such a vital matter all the materials for a comfortable though
somewhat rude life were right at hand it made little difference to a
nation fighting for existence if silks fine linens and chinaware were
cut off this was an evil to which submission was necessarynor did the brilliant exploits of john paul jones and captain john barry
materially change the situation they demonstrated the skill of american
seamen and their courage as fighting men they raised the rates of
british marine insurance but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
seas less spectacular and more distinctive were the deeds of the
hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled british supply
ships and kept british merchantmen in constant anxiety not until the
french fleet was thrown into the scale were the british compelled to
reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
possibilities of a maritime disaster commanding officers   on the score of military leadership it is
difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest
there is no doubt that all the british commanders were men of experience
in the art of warfare sir william howe had served in america during the
french war and was accounted an excellent officer a strict
disciplinarian and a gallant gentleman nevertheless he loved ease
society and good living and his expulsion from boston his failure to
overwhelm washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at new york
and philadelphia destroyed every shred of his military reputation john
burgoyne to whom was given the task of penetrating new york from
canada had likewise seen service in the french war both in america and
europe he had however a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777
he devoted his time mainly to light literature sir henry clinton who
directed the movement which ended in the capture of charleston in 1780
had learned his trade on the continent and was regarded as a man of
discretion and understanding in military matters lord cornwallis whose
achievements at camden and guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
yorktown had seen service in the seven years war and had undoubted
talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
india though none of them perhaps were men of first rate ability
they all had training and experience to guide them illustration george washington the americans had a host in washington himself he had long been
interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
during the first clashes with the french nearly twenty years before he
had no doubts about the justice of his cause such as plagued some of
the british generals he was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian he
was reserved and patient little given to exaltation at success or
depression at reverses in the dark hour of the revolution what held
the patriot forces together? asks beveridge in his life of john
marshall then he answers george washington and he alone had he
died or been seriously disabled the revolution would have ended
washington was the soul of the american cause washington was the
government washington was the revolution the weakness of congress in
furnishing men and supplies the indolence of civilians who lived at
ease while the army starved the intrigues of army officers against him
such as the conway cabal the cowardice of lee at monmouth even the
treason of benedict arnold while they stirred deep emotions in his
breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen did
not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
to the bitter end the weight of washingtons moral force was
immeasurableof the generals who served under him none can really be said to have
been experienced military men when the war opened benedict arnold the
unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier was a druggist book
seller and ship owner at new haven when the news of lexington called
him to battle horatio gates was looked upon as a seasoned soldier
because he had entered the british army as a youth had been wounded at
braddocks memorable defeat and had served with credit during the seven
years war but he was the most conspicuous failure of the revolution
the triumph over burgoyne was the work of other men and his crushing
defeat at camden put an end to his military pretensions nathanael
greene was a rhode island farmer and smith without military experience
who when convinced that war was coming read caesars commentaries and
took up the sword francis marion was a shy and modest planter of south
carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
with the indians ten or twelve years earlier daniel morgan one of the
heroes of cowpens had been a teamster with braddocks army and had seen
some fighting during the french and indian war but his military
knowledge from the point of view of a trained british officer was
negligible john sullivan was a successful lawyer at durham new
hampshire and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
lay down his briefs and take up the sword anthony wayne was a
pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who on hearing the clash of arms
read a few books on war raised a regiment and offered himself for
service such is the story of the chief american military leaders and
it is typical of them all some had seen fighting with the french and
indians but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in european
experience courage native ability quickness of mind and knowledge of
the country they had in abundance and in battles such as were fought
during the revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
balance foreign officers in american service   to native genius was added
military talent from beyond the seas baron steuben well schooled in
the iron regime of frederick the great came over from prussia joined
washington at valley forge and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
men laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
soldiers from france came young lafayette and the stern de kalb from
poland came pulaski and kosciusko  all acquainted with the arts of war
as waged in europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching
lafayette came early in 1776 in a ship of his own accompanied by
several officers of wide experience and remained loyally throughout the
war sharing the hardships of american army life pulaski fell at the
siege of savannah and de kalb at camden kosciusko survived the american
war to defend in vain the independence of his native land to these
distinguished foreigners who freely threw in their lot with american
revolutionary fortunes was due much of that spirit and discipline which
fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
power of the first rank the soldiers   as far as the british soldiers were concerned their
annals are short and simple the regulars from the standing army who
were sent over at the opening of the contest the recruits drummed up
by special efforts at home and the thousands of hessians bought
outright by king george presented few problems of management to the
british officers these common soldiers were far away from home and
enlisted for the war nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
of them experienced in actual campaigns the armies of king george
fought bravely as the records of bunker hill brandywine and monmouth
demonstrate many a man and subordinate officer and for that matter
some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
their own kin but they obeyed ordersthe americans on the other hand while they fought with grim
determination as men fighting for their homes were lacking in
discipline and in the experience of regular troops when the war broke
in upon them there were no common preparations for it there was no
continental army there were only local bands of militiamen many of
them experienced in fighting but few of them regulars in the military
sense moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time
unaccustomed to severe discipline and impatient at the restraints
imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns they were continually
leaving the service just at the most critical moments the militia
lamented washington come in you cannot tell how go you cannot tell
where consume your provisions exhaust your stores and leave you at
last at a critical momentagain and again washington begged congress to provide for an army of
regulars enlisted for the war thoroughly trained and paid according to
some definite plan at last he was able to overcome in part at least
the chronic fear of civilians in congress and to wring from that
reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war even this
scheme which washington regarded as far short of justice to the
soldiers did not produce quick results it was near the close of the
conflict before he had an army of well disciplined veterans capable of
meeting british regulars on equal termsthough there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
effective work it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
time honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
forces of regulars in a seven years war for independence they did
nothing of the sort for the victories of bennington trenton saratoga
and yorktown there were the defeats of bunker hill long island white
plains germantown and camden not once did an army of militiamen
overcome an equal number of british regulars in an open trial by battle
to bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier wrote
washington requires time to expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
did and perhaps never will happen how the war was won   then how did the american army win the war? for
one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the british
generals who in 1775 and 1776 dallied in boston and new york with
large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the american
army nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
us solemnly averred washington in 1780 still it is fair to say that
this apparent supineness was not all due to the british generals the
ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
war vigorously prosecuted victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
better than conquest and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
healing later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of france were
thrown into the scale the americans themselves had learned many things
about the practical conduct of campaigns all along the british were
embarrassed by the problem of supplies their troops could not forage
with the skill of militiamen as they were in unfamiliar territory the
long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
warships of france joined the american privateers in preying on supply
boatsthe british were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
outdone on two important occasions by superior forces  at saratoga and
yorktown stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army which
could be raised only by a supreme effort would be necessary to subdue
the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all
they learned also that america would then be alienated fretful and the
scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation that was a
price which staggered even lord north and george iii moreover there
were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon women and the war   at no time were the women of america indifferent
to the struggle for independence when it was confined to the realm of
opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment mrs elizabeth
timothee for example founded in charleston in 1773 a newspaper to
espouse the cause of the province far to the north the sister of james
otis mrs mercy warren early begged her countrymen to rest their case
upon their natural rights and in influential circles she urged the
leaders to stand fast by their principles while john adams was tossing
about with uncertainty at the continental congress his wife was writing
letters to him declaring her faith in independencywhen the war came down upon the country women helped in every field in
sustaining public sentiment they were active mrs warren with a
tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire
almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
service in the second line of defense mrs washington managed the
plantation while the general was at the front and went north to face the
rigors of the awful winter at valley forge  an inspiration to her
husband and his men the daughter of benjamin franklin mrs sarah
bache while her father was pleading the american cause in france set
the women of pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies even
near the firing line women were to be found aiding the wounded hauling
powder to the front and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
livesin the economic sphere the work of women was invaluable they harvested
crops without enjoying the picturesque title of farmerettes and they
canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war of their
labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded immediately on being cut
off from the use of english manufactures the women engaged within their
own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use
they thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
themselves in this way the female part of families by their industry
and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle
evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
servicefor their war work women were commended by high authorities on more
than one occasion they were given medals and public testimonials even
as in our own day washington thanked them for their labors and paid
tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
given to the cause of independence
the finances of the revolutionwhen the revolution opened there were thirteen little treasuries in
america but no common treasury and from first to last the congress was
in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign having no authority
to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
provincials for taxation it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
finance the war do you think boldly inquired one of the delegates
that i will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
to the printer and get a wagon load of money one quire of which will
pay for the whole? paper money and loans   acting on this curious but appealing political
economy congress issued in june 1776 two million dollars in bills of
credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
populations other issues followed in quick succession in all about
$241000000 of continental paper was printed to which the several
states added nearly $210000000 of their own notes then came
interest bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities several millions
were also borrowed from france and small sums from holland and spain in
desperation a national lottery was held producing meager results the
property of tories was confiscated and sold bringing in about
$16000000 begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
raise revenues for the continental treasury but the states burdened
with their own affairs gave little heed inflation and depreciation   as paper money flowed from the press it
rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
only two or three cents in gold or silver attempts were made by
congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
value but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill
speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
republic fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
securities while the patriot army half clothed was freezing at valley
forge speculation peculation engrossing forestalling exclaimed
washington afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
virtue nothing i am convinced but the depreciation of our currency
 aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
the enemy the patriot financiers   to the efforts of congress in financing the
war were added the labors of private citizens hayn solomon a merchant
of philadelphia supplied members of congress including madison
jefferson and monroe and army officers like lee and steuben with
money for their daily needs all together he contributed the huge sum of
half a million dollars to the american cause and died broken in purse
if not in spirit a british prisoner of war another philadelphia
merchant robert morris won for himself the name of the patriot
financier because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government when his own
funds were exhausted he borrowed from his friends experienced in the
handling of merchandise he created agencies at important points to
distribute supplies to the troops thus displaying administrative as
well as financial talents illustration robert morris women organized drives for money contributed their plate and their
jewels and collected from door to door farmers took worthless paper in
return for their produce and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
yielding them a penny thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens
the issuance of paper money lotteries the floating of loans
borrowings in europe and the impressment of supplies the congress
staggered through the revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
kindly fate
the diplomacy of the revolutionwhen the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
their commanding officers the civilians who managed finances and
supplies the writers who sustained the american spirit and the women
who did well their part there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
achievements of diplomacy the importance of this field of activity was
keenly appreciated by the leaders in the continental congress they were
fairly well versed in european history they knew of the balance of
power and the sympathies interests and prejudices of nations and their
rulers all this information they turned to good account in opening
relations with continental countries and seeking money supplies and
even military assistance for the transaction of this delicate business
they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
1775 and prepared to send agents abroad american agents sent abroad   having heard that france was inclining a
friendly ear to the american cause the congress in march 1776 sent a
commissioner to paris silas deane of connecticut often styled the
first american diplomat later in the year a form of treaty to be
presented to foreign powers was drawn up and franklin arthur lee and
deane were selected as american representatives at the court of his
most christian majesty the king of france john jay of new york was
chosen minister to spain in 1779 john adams was sent to holland the
same year and other agents were dispatched to florence vienna and
berlin the representative selected for st petersburg spent two
fruitless years there ignored by the court living in obscurity and
experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure frederick the great
king of prussia expressed a desire to find in america a market for
silesian linens and woolens but fearing englands command of the sea
he refused to give direct aid to the revolutionary cause early french interest   the great diplomatic triumph of the revolution
was won at paris and benjamin franklin was the hero of the occasion
although many circumstances prepared the way for his success louis
xvis foreign minister count de vergennes before the arrival of any
american representative had brought to the attention of the king the
opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between england and her
colonies he showed him how france could redress her grievances and
reduce the power and greatness of england  the empire that in 1763 had
forced upon her a humiliating peace at the price of our possessions
of our commerce and our credit in the indies at the price of canada
louisiana isle royale acadia and senegal equally successful in
gaining the kings interest was a curious french adventurer
beaumarchais a man of wealth a lover of music and the author of two
popular plays figaro and the barber of seville these two men had
already urged upon the king secret aid for america before deane appeared
on the scene shortly after his arrival they made confidential
arrangements to furnish money clothing powder and other supplies to
the struggling colonies although official requests for them were
officially refused by the french government franklin at paris   when franklin reached paris he was received only
in private by the kings minister vergennes the french people
however made manifest their affection for the plain republican in
his full dress suit of spotted manchester velvet he was known among
men of letters as an author a scientist and a philosopher of
extraordinary ability his poor richard had thrice been translated
into french and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
kingdom people of all ranks  ministers ladies at court philosophers
peasants and stable boys  knew of franklin and wished him success in
his mission the queen marie antoinette fated to lose her head in a
revolution soon to follow played with fire by encouraging our dear
republicanfor the king of france however this was more serious business england
resented the presence of this traitor in paris and louis had to be
cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
disastrously moreover the early period of franklins sojourn in paris
was a dark hour for the american revolution washingtons brilliant
exploit at trenton on christmas night 1776 and the battle with
cornwallis at princeton had been followed by the disaster at brandywine
the loss of philadelphia the defeat at germantown and the retirement
to valley forge for the winter of 1777 78 new york city and
philadelphia  two strategic ports  were in british hands the hudson
and delaware rivers were blocked and general burgoyne with his british
troops was on his way down through the heart of northern new york
cutting new england off from the rest of the colonies no wonder the
king was cautious then the unexpected happened burgoyne hemmed in
from all sides by the american forces his flanks harried his foraging
parties beaten back his supplies cut off surrendered on october 17
1777 to general gates who had superseded general schuyler in time to
receive the honor treaties of alliance and commerce 1778   news of this victory
placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world
reached franklin one night early in december while he and some friends
sat gloomily at dinner beaumarchais who was with him grasped at once
the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at versailles with
such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm the king and
his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
revolution treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
in february 1778 the independence of the united states was recognized
by france and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence
combined military action was agreed upon and louis then formally
declared war on england men who had a few short years before fought
one another in the wilderness of pennsylvania or on the plains of
abraham were now ranged side by side in a war on the empire that pitt
had erected and that george iii was pulling down spain and holland involved   within a few months spain remembering
the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the armada and
hoping to drive the british out of gibraltar once more joined the
concert of nations against england holland a member of a league of
armed neutrals formed in protest against british searches on the high
seas sent her fleet to unite with the forces of spain france and
america to prey upon british commerce to all this trouble for england
was added the danger of a possible revolt in ireland where the spirit
of independence was flaming up the british offer terms to america   seeing the colonists about to be
joined by france in a common war on the english empire lord north
proposed in february 1778 a renewal of negotiations by solemn
enactment parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
of imposing taxes within the colonies at the same time it authorized
the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to america
a truce was to be established pardons granted objectionable laws
suspended and the old imperial constitution as it stood before the
opening of hostilities restored to full vigor it was too late events
had taken the affairs of america out of the hands of british
commissioners and diplomats effects of french aid   the french alliance brought ships of war
large sums of gold and silver loads of supplies and a considerable
body of trained soldiers to the aid of the americans timely as was this
help it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war the british
evacuated philadelphia in the summer following the alliance and
washingtons troops were encouraged to come out of valley forge they
inflicted a heavy blow on the british at monmouth but the treasonable
conduct of general charles lee prevented a triumph the recovery of
philadelphia was offset by the treason of benedict arnold the loss of
savannah and charleston 1780 and the defeat of gates at camdenthe full effect of the french alliance was not felt until 1781 when
cornwallis went into virginia and settled at yorktown accompanied by
french troops washington swept rapidly southward and penned the british
to the shore while a powerful french fleet shut off their escape by sea
it was this movement which certainly could not have been executed
without french aid that put an end to all chance of restoring british
dominion in america it was the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown that
caused lord north to pace the floor and cry out it is all over  it is
all over  what might have been done without the french alliance lies
hidden from mankind what was accomplished with the help of french
soldiers sailors officers money and supplies is known to all the
earth all the world agree exultantly wrote franklin from paris to
general washington that no expedition was ever better planned or
better executed it brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
the latest posterity diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
reward
peace at last british opposition to the war   in measuring the forces that led to
the final discomfiture of king george and lord north it is necessary to
remember that from the beginning to the end the british ministry at home
faced a powerful informed and relentless opposition there were
vigorous protests first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
the unhappy quarrel then against the way in which the war was waged
and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
american dominions among the members of parliament who thundered
against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land
william pitt earl of chatham though he deplored the idea of american
independence denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
american resistance edmund burke leveled his heavy batteries against
every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which while
giving independence to america would work for reconciliation rather
than estrangement charles james fox gave the colonies his generous
sympathy and warmly championed their rights outside of the circle of
statesmen there were stout friends of the american cause like david
hume the philosopher and historian and catherine macaulay an author
of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage washington in
seeing it throughagainst this powerful opposition the government enlisted a whole army
of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the americans and
their friends dr samuel johnson whom it employed in this business
was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
before printing them far more weighty was edward gibbon who was in
time to win fame as the historian of the decline and fall of the roman
empire he had at first opposed the government but on being given a
lucrative post he used his sharp pen in its support causing his
friends to ridicule him in these lines    king george in a fright
     lest gibbon should write
       the story of englands disgrace
     thought no way so sure
     his pen to secure
       as to give the historian a place lord north yields   as time wore on events bore heavily on the side
of the opponents of the governments measures they had predicted that
conquest was impossible and they had urged the advantages of a peace
which would in some measure restore the affections of the americans
every days news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
arguments moreover the war which sprang out of an effort to relieve
english burdens made those burdens heavier than ever military expenses
were daily increasing trade with the colonies the greatest single
outlet for british goods and capital was paralyzed the heavy debts due
british merchants in america were not only unpaid but postponed into an
indefinite future ireland was on the verge of revolution the french
had a dangerous fleet on the high seas in vain did the king assert in
december 1781 that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
peace that meant american independence parliament knew better and on
february 27 1782 in the house of commons was carried an address to the
throne against continuing the war burke fox the younger pitt barre
and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative lord north
gave notice then that his ministry was at an end the king moaned
necessity made me yieldin april 1782 franklin received word from the english government that
it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement this
was embarrassing in the treaty of alliance with france the united
states had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
both nations in open conference finding france however opposed to
some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries the american
commissioners conferred with the british agents at paris without
consulting the french minister they actually signed a preliminary peace
draft before they informed him of their operations when vergennes
reproached him franklin replied that they had been guilty of
neglecting bienseance  good manners  but hoped that the great work
would not be ruined by a single indiscretion the terms of peace 1783   the general settlement at paris in 1783
was a triumph for america england recognized the independence of the
united states naming each state specifically and agreed to boundaries
extending from the atlantic to the mississippi and from the great lakes
to the floridas england held canada newfoundland and the west indies
intact made gains in india and maintained her supremacy on the seas
spain won florida and minorca but not the coveted gibraltar france
gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing england humbled
and the colonies independentthe generous terms secured by the american commission at paris called
forth surprise and gratitude in the united states and smoothed the way
for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country at the
same time they gave genuine anxiety to european diplomats this federal
republic is born a pigmy wrote the spanish ambassador to his royal
master a day will come when it will be a giant even a colossus
formidable to these countries liberty of conscience and the facility
for establishing a new population on immense lands as well as the
advantages of the new government will draw thither farmers and artisans
from all the nations in a few years we shall watch with grief the
tyrannical existence of the same colossus illustration north america according to the treaty of 1783 
summary of the revolutionary periodthe independence of the american colonies was foreseen by many european
statesmen as they watched the growth of their population wealth and
power but no one could fix the hour of the great event until 1763 the
american colonists lived fairly happily under british dominion there
were collisions from time to time of course royal governors clashed
with stiff necked colonial legislatures there were protests against the
exercise of the kings veto power in specific cases nevertheless on
the whole the relations between america and the mother country were
more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the stuart regime which
closed in 1688the crash when it came was not deliberately willed by any one it was
the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763
three years before there had come to the throne george iii a young
proud inexperienced and stubborn king for nearly fifty years his
predecessors germans as they were in language and interest had allowed
things to drift in england and america george iii decided that he would
be king in fact as well as in name about the same time england brought
to a close the long and costly french and indian war and was staggering
under a heavy burden of debt and taxes the war had been fought partly
in defense of the american colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
to english statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
the cost of their own defense at this juncture there came into
prominence in royal councils two men bent on taxing america and
controlling her trade grenville and townshend the king was willing
the english taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief and
statesmen were found to undertake the experiment england therefore set
out upon a new course she imposed taxes upon the colonists regulated
their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law this
action evoked protests from the colonists they held a stamp act
congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
grievances some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets
sacked the houses of the kings officers and tore up the stamped paperfrightened by uprising the english government drew back and repealed
the stamp act then it veered again and renewed its policy of
interference interference again called forth american protests
protests aroused sharper retaliation more british regulars were sent
over to keep order more irritating laws were passed by parliament
rioting again appeared tea was dumped in the harbor of boston and
seized in the harbor of charleston the british answer was more force
the response of the colonists was a continental congress for defense an
unexpected and unintended clash of arms at lexington and concord in the
spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of england a proclamation
the americans are rebels the die was cast the american revolution had begun washington was made
commander in chief armies were raised money was borrowed a huge
volume of paper currency was issued and foreign aid was summoned
franklin plied his diplomatic arts at paris until in 1778 he induced
france to throw her sword into the balance three years later
cornwallis surrendered at yorktown in 1783 by the formal treaty of
peace george iii acknowledged the independence of the united states
the new nation endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
atlantic ocean to the mississippi river began its career among the
sovereign powers of the earthin the sphere of civil government the results of the revolution were
equally remarkable royal officers and royal authorities were driven
from the former dominions all power was declared to be in the people
all the colonies became states each with its own constitution or plan
of government the thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
articles of confederation a republic on a large scale was instituted
thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
world had never seen could it succeed or was it destined to break down
and be supplanted by a monarchy? the fate of whole continents hung upon

chapter viithe formation of the constitution
the promise and the difficulties of americathe rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states each governed
by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by the plain
people was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century the
majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good those
americans however who peered beneath the surface of things saw that
the declaration of independence even if splendidly phrased and paper
constitutions drawn by finest enthusiasm uninstructed by experience
could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free all
around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
immediate future the weakness of the articles of confederation   the government under
the articles of confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war
the sole organ of government was a congress composed of from two to
seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
paid by the state in determining all questions each state had one
vote  delaware thus enjoying the same weight as virginia there was no
president to enforce the laws congress was given power to select a
committee of thirteen  one from each state  to act as an executive body
when it was not in session but this device on being tried out proved
a failure there was no system of national courts to which citizens and
states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
they could compel obedience to law the two great powers of government
military and financial were withheld congress it is true could
authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
of contributions to meet its bills it could also order the
establishment of an army but it could only request the states to supply
their respective quotas of soldiers it could not lay taxes nor bring
any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country it
could act only through the medium of the state governments financial and commercial disorders   in the field of public finance
the disorders were pronounced the huge debt incurred during the war was
still outstanding congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
principal public creditors were in despair as the market value of
their bonds sank to twenty five or even ten cents on the dollar the
current bills of congress were unpaid as some one complained there was
not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
the transactions of the shadow legislature the currency was in utter
chaos millions of dollars in notes issued by congress had become mere
trash worth a cent or two on the dollar there was no other expression
of contempt so forceful as the popular saying not worth a
continental to make matters worse several of the states were pouring
new streams of paper money from the press almost the only good money in
circulation consisted of english french and spanish coins and the
public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
clipping and filing away the metal foreign commerce was unsettled the
entire british system of trade discrimination was turned against the
americans and congress having no power to regulate foreign commerce
was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce
domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states which
erected tariff barriers against their neighbors the condition of the
currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult and
as if to increase the confusion backward states enacted laws hindering
the prompt collection of debts within their borders  an evil which
nothing but a national system of courts could cure congress in disrepute   with treaties set at naught by the states the
laws unenforced the treasury empty and the public credit gone the
congress of the united states fell into utter disrepute it called upon
the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury only to be
treated with contempt even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
futility some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it and
many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions
again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
of business troubles of the state governments   the state governments free to
pursue their own course with no interference from without had almost as
many difficulties as the congress they too were loaded with
revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
population oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
fall in prices which followed the return of peace the farmers of
several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
legislatures to issue large sums of paper money the currency fell in
value but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
old accountsin every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently
laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
third year lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
canceled by its successor uncertainty and distrust were the natural
consequences men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
states to issue bills of credit to make paper money legal tender in
payment of debts or to impair the obligation of contracts men heavily
in debt on the other hand urged even more drastic action against
creditorsso great did the discontent of the farmers in new hampshire become in
1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature demanding a repeal of the
taxes and the issuance of paper money it was with difficulty that an
armed rebellion was avoided in massachusetts the malcontents under the
leadership of daniel shays a captain in the revolutionary army
organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state
shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
foreclosing mortgages upon the debt burdened farmers against the
lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings against the
senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid against heavy taxes and
against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money they seized
the towns of worcester and springfield and broke up the courts of
justice all through the western part of the state the revolt spread
sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
republic only by the most vigorous action was governor bowdoin able to
quell the uprising and when that task was accomplished the state
government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
so many sympathizers moreover bowdoin and several members of the
legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
were defeated at the ensuing election the need of national assistance
for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts alarm over dangers to the republic   leading american citizens
watching the drift of affairs were slowly driven to the conclusion that
the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
careening into anarchy the facts of our peace and independence wrote
a friend of washington do not at present wear so promising an
appearance as i had fondly painted in my mind the prejudices
jealousies and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
confidence in our political establishments and almost occasion me to
think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
which we have contendedwashington himself was profoundly discouraged on hearing of shayss
rebellion he exclaimed what gracious god is man that there should
be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct  it is but the
other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
under which we now live  constitutions of our own choice and making  and
now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them the same year he
burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government i am
told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
without horror from thinking proceeds speaking hence to acting is
often but a single step but how irresistible and tremendous  what a
triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions  what a triumph for
the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
ourselves  congress attempts some reforms   the congress was not indifferent to
the events that disturbed washington on the contrary it put forth many
efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance commerce
industries and the confederation itself in 1781 even before the
treaty of peace was signed the congress having found out how futile
were its taxing powers carried a resolution of amendment to the
articles of confederation authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
imports yet this mild measure was rejected by the states two years
later the congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
duties on imports to be collected this time by state officers and
applied to the payment of the public debt this more limited proposal
designed to save public credit likewise failed in 1786 the congress
made a third appeal to the states for help declaring that they had been
so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
dangerous
the calling of a constitutional convention hamilton and washington urge reform   the attempts at reform by the
congress were accompanied by demand for both within and without that
body a convention to frame a new plan of government in 1780 the
youthful alexander hamilton realizing the weakness of the articles so
widely discussed proposed a general convention for the purpose of
drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles with
tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view
washington agreeing with him on every point declared in a circular
letter to the governors that the duration of the union would be short
unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power to regulate and
govern the general concerns of the confederated republic the governor
of massachusetts disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him
suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a
national convention to enlarge the powers of the congress the
legislature approved the plan but did not press it to a conclusion illustration alexander hamilton  the annapolis convention   action finally came from the south the
virginia legislature taking things into its own hands called a
conference of delegates at annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
commerce when the convention assembled in 1786 it was found that only
five states had taken the trouble to send representatives the leaders
were deeply discouraged but the resourceful hamilton a delegate from
new york turned the affair to good account he secured the adoption of
a resolution calling upon the congress itself to summon another
convention to meet at philadelphia a national convention called 1787   the congress as tardy as ever
at last decided in february 1787 to issue the call fearing drastic
changes however it restricted the convention to the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation jealous of its own
powers it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
congress and the states for their approvalevery state in the union except rhode island responded to this call
indeed some of the states having the annapolis resolution before them
had already anticipated the congress by selecting delegates before the
formal summons came thus by the persistence of governors
legislatures and private citizens there was brought about the
long desired national convention in may 1787 it assembled in
philadelphia the eminent men of the convention   on the roll of that memorable
convention were fifty five men at least half of whom were acknowledged
to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in america every field
of statecraft was represented by them war and practical management in
washington who was chosen president of the convention diplomacy in
franklin now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad
finance in alexander hamilton and robert morris law in james wilson of
pennsylvania the philosophy of government in james madison called the
father of the constitution they were not theorists but practical men
rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
springs of human action three of them had served in the stamp act
congress dickinson of delaware william samuel johnson of connecticut
and john rutledge of south carolina eight had been signers of the
declaration of independence read of delaware sherman of connecticut
wythe of virginia gerry of massachusetts franklin robert morris
george clymer and james wilson of pennsylvania all but twelve had at
some time served in the continental congress and eighteen were members
of that body in the spring of 1787 washington hamilton mifflin and
charles pinckney had been officers in the revolutionary army seven of
the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states
the convention as a whole according to the historian hildreth
represented in a marked manner the talent intelligence and
especially the conservative sentiment of the country
the framing of the constitution problems involved   the great problems before the convention were nine
in number 1 shall the articles of confederation be revised or a new
system of government constructed? 2 shall the government be founded on
states equal in power as under the articles or on the broader and deeper
foundation of population? 3 what direct share shall the people have in
the election of national officers? 4 what shall be the qualifications
for the suffrage? 5 how shall the conflicting interests of the
commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
essential rights of each? 6 what shall be the form of the new
government? 7 what powers shall be conferred on it? 8 how shall the
state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
such as the issuance of paper money? 9 shall the approval of all the
states be necessary as under the articles for the adoption and
amendment of the constitution? revision of the articles or a new government?   the moment the first
problem was raised representatives of the small states led by william
paterson of new jersey were on their feet they feared that if the
articles were overthrown the equality and rights of the states would be
put in jeopardy their protest was therefore vigorous they cited the
call issued by the congress in summoning the convention which
specifically stated that they were assembled for the sole and express
purpose of revising the articles of confederation they cited also
their instructions from their state legislatures which authorized them
to revise and amend the existing scheme of government not to make a
revolution in it to depart from the authorization laid down by the
congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers they
argued and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymento their contentions randolph of virginia replied when the salvation
of the republic is at stake it would be treason to our trust not to
propose what we find necessary hamilton reminding the delegates that
their work was still subject to the approval of the states frankly said
that on the point of their powers he had no scruples with the issue
clear the convention cast aside the articles as if they did not exist
and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution laying its
foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form
as to the delegates seemed most likely to affect their safety and
happiness a government founded on states or on people?  the
compromise   defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
mere revision of the articles the spokesmen of the smaller states
redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states the
signal for a radical departure from the articles on this point was given
early in the sessions when randolph presented the virginia plan he
proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses the
members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
their wealth or free white population as the convention might decide
this plan was vehemently challenged paterson of new jersey flatly
avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny as
an alternative he presented the new jersey plan calling for a
national legislature of one house representing states as such not
wealth or people  a legislature in which all states large or small
would have equal voice wilson of pennsylvania on behalf of the more
populous states took up the gauntlet which paterson had thrown down it
was absurd he urged for 180000 men in one state to have the same
weight in national counsels as 750000 men in another state the
gentleman from new jersey he said is candid he declares his opinion
boldly i will be equally candid i will never confederate on his
principles so the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
sessionsgreek had met greek the convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
verge of dissolution scarce held together by the strength of a hair
as one of the delegates remarked a crash was averted only by a
compromise instead of a congress of one house as provided by the
articles the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses in the
senate the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied for
each state was given two members in that body in the formation of the
house of representatives the larger states were placated for it was
agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
states on the basis of population counting three fifths of the slaves the question of popular election   the method of selecting federal
officers and members of congress also produced an acrimonious debate
which revealed how deep seated was the distrust of the capacity of the
people to govern themselves few there were who believed that no branch
of the government should be elected directly by the voters still fewer
were there however who desired to see all branches so chosen one or
two even expressed a desire for a monarchy the dangers of democracy
were stressed by gerry of massachusetts all the evils we experience
flow from an excess of democracy the people do not want virtue but are
the dupes of pretended patriots i have been too republican
heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
spirit to the democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures
randolph sought to oppose a firm senate to check the excesses of
popular government charles pinckney of south carolina declared that no
one should be elected president who was not worth $100000 and that high
property qualifications should be placed on members of congress and
judges other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
high toned notions of government franklin and wilson both from
pennsylvania vigorously championed popular election while men like
madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
the broad foundation of the peopleout of this clash of opinion also came compromise one branch the house
of representatives it was agreed was to be elected directly by the
voters while the senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
legislatures the president was to be chosen by electors selected as the
legislatures of the states might determine and the judges of the
federal courts supreme and inferior by the president and the senate the question of the suffrage   the battle over the suffrage was sharp
but brief gouverneur morris proposed that only land owners should be
permitted to vote madison replied that the state legislatures which
had made so much trouble with radical laws were elected by freeholders
after the debate the delegates unable to agree on any property
limitations on the suffrage decided that the house of representatives
should be elected by voters having the qualifications requisite for
electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature thus
they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states the balance between the planting and the commercial states   after the
debates had gone on for a few weeks madison came to the conclusion that
the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
the commercial north thus he anticipated by nearly three quarters of a
century the irrepressible conflict the planting states had neither
the free white population nor the wealth of the north there were
counting delaware six of them as against seven commercial states
dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco rice
and other staples abroad they feared that congress might impose
restraints upon their enterprise being weaker in numbers they were
afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon themrepresentation and taxation  the southern members of the convention
were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
possible representation in congress and at the same time to restrain
the taxing power of that body two devices were thought adapted to these
ends one was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
representatives among the states according to their respective
populations the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
apportioned among the states in proportion not to their wealth but to
the number of their free white inhabitants for obvious reasons the
northern delegates objected to these proposals once more a compromise
proved to be the solution it was agreed that not all the slaves but
three fifths of them should be counted for both purposes  representation
and direct taxationcommerce and the slave trade  southern interests were also involved
in the project to confer upon congress the power to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce to the manufacturing and trading states this was
essential it would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies it
would enable congress to protect american manufactures and to break
down by appropriate retaliations foreign discriminations against
american commerce to the south the proposal was menacing because
tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
plantations in european markets and navigation acts might confine the
carrying trade to american that is northern ships the importation of
slaves moreover it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
prohibited altogetherthe result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
of slavery gouverneur morris delivered his mind and heart on that
subject denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
heaven on the states in which it prevailed mason of virginia a
slaveholder himself was hardly less outspoken saying slavery
discourages arts and manufactures the poor despise labor when performed
by slaves they prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
and enrich a countrythe system however had its defenders representatives from south
carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
importation necessary ellsworth of connecticut took the ground that
the convention should not meddle with slavery the morality or wisdom
of slavery he said are considerations belonging to the states what
enriches a part enriches the whole to the future he turned an
untroubled face as population increases poor laborers will be so
plenty as to render slaves useless slavery in time will not be a speck
in our country virginia and north carolina already overstocked with
slaves favored prohibiting the traffic in them but south carolina was
adamant she must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
federateso it was agreed that while congress might regulate foreign trade by
majority vote the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
the lapse of twenty years and that any import tax should not exceed $10
a head at the same time in connection with the regulation of foreign
trade it was stipulated that a two thirds vote in the senate should be
necessary in the ratification of treaties a further concession to the
south was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves  a
provision also useful in the north where indentured servants were about
as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters the form of the government   as to the details of the frame of
government and the grand principles involved the opinion of the
convention ebbed and flowed decisions being taken in the heat of
debate only to be revoked and taken againthe executive  there was general agreement that there should be an
executive branch for reliance upon congress to enforce its own laws and
treaties had been a broken reed on the character and functions of the
executive however there were many views the new jersey plan called
for a council selected by the congress the virginia plan provided that
the executive branch should be chosen by the congress but did not state
whether it should be composed of one or several persons on this matter
the convention voted first one way and then another finally it agreed
on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
state legislatures might decide serving for four years subject to
impeachment and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
and the navy and in the enforcement of the lawsthe legislative branch  congress  after the convention had made the
great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
representation to states in the senate and to population in the house
the question of methods of election had to be decided as to the house
of representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
elected by direct popular vote there was also easy agreement on the
proposition that a strong senate was needed to check the turbulence of
the lower house four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
purpose in the first place the senators were not to be chosen directly
by the voters but by the legislatures of the states thus removing their
election one degree from the populace in the second place their term
was fixed at six years instead of two as in the case of the house in
the third place provision was made for continuity by having only
one third of the members go out at a time while two thirds remained in
service finally it was provided that senators must be at least thirty
years old while representatives need be only twenty fivethe judiciary  the need for federal courts to carry out the law was
hardly open to debate the feebleness of the articles of confederation
was in a large measure attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
union nevertheless on this point the advocates of states rights were
extremely sensitive they looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
traditions they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
against britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries
reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts consenting at
first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as congress might
deem necessarythe system of checks and balances  it is thus apparent that the
framers of the constitution in shaping the form of government arranged
for a distribution of power among three branches executive
legislative and judicial strictly speaking we might say four branches
for the legislature or congress was composed of two houses elected in
different ways and one of them the senate was made a check on the
president through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments the
accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judicial in the
same hands wrote madison whether of one a few or many and whether
hereditary self appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the
very definition of tyranny the devices which the convention adopted to
prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authorsthe legislature consisted of two houses the members of which were to be
apportioned on a different basis elected in different ways and to
serve for different terms a veto on all its acts was vested in a
president elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
branch of the legislature serving for four years and subject to
removal only by the difficult process of impeachment after a law had
run the gantlet of both houses and the executive it was subject to
interpretation and annulment by the judiciary appointed by the
president with the consent of the senate and serving for life thus it
was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
all branches of the government at a single popular election as hamilton
remarked the friends of good government considered every institution
calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
likely to do good than harm the powers of the federal government   on the question of the powers
to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
serious dispute even the delegates from the small states agreed with
those from massachusetts pennsylvania and virginia that new powers
should be added to those intrusted to congress by the articles of
confederation the new jersey plan as well as the virginia plan
recognized this fact some of the delegates like hamilton and madison
even proposed to give congress a general legislative authority covering
all national matters but others frightened by the specter of
nationalism insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
finally carried the daytaxation and commerce  there were none bold enough to dissent from
the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
and discharge the public debt when once the dispute over the
apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled it was
an easy matter to decide that congress should have power to lay and
collect taxes duties imposts and excises in this way the national
government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens there
were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured when the
fears of the planting states were allayed and the bargain over the
importation of slaves was reached the convention vested in congress the
power to regulate foreign and interstate commercenational defense  the necessity for national defense was realized
though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present the
old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
was completely discredited as in the case of taxes a direct authority
over citizens was demanded congress was therefore given full power to
raise and support armies and a navy it could employ the state militia
when desirable but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
and call directly upon all able bodied males if the nature of a crisis
was thought to require itthe necessary and proper clause  to the specified power vested in
congress by the constitution the advocates of a strong national
government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
necessary and proper for carrying into effect any and all of the
enumerated powers this clause interpreted by that master mind chief
justice marshall was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
among the mighty nations of the earth restraints on the states   framing a government and endowing it with
large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention its
very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed continental congress
in every state explains marshall in his life of washington there was
a party of men who had marked out for themselves a more indulgent
course viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor their
efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief to exact a faithful
compliance with contracts was in their opinion a harsh measure which
the people could not bear they were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
administration of justice of affording facilities for the payment of
debts or of suspending their collection and remitting taxesthe legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily
the convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
tender in the payment of debts the state legislatures had enacted laws
allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
personal property they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees and they
had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements the
convention taking notice of such matters inserted a clause forbidding
states to impair the obligation of contracts the more venturous of
the radicals had in massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
the authorities of the state the convention answered by a brief
sentence to the effect that the president of the united states to be
equipped with a regular army would send troops to suppress domestic
insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or if it was not
in session by the governor of the state to make sure that the
restrictions on the states would not be dead letters the federal
constitution laws and treaties were made the supreme law of the land
to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
against violations on the part of any state authorities provisions for ratification and amendment   when the frame of
government had been determined the powers to be vested in it had been
enumerated and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
the bond there remained three final questions how shall the
constitution be ratified? what number of states shall be necessary to
put it into effect? how shall it be amended in the future?on the first point the mandate under which the convention was sitting
seemed positive the articles of confederation were still in effect
they provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
in congress and the approval of all the states as if to give force to
this provision of law the call for the convention had expressly stated
that all alterations and revisions should be reported to congress for
adoption or rejection congress itself to transmit the document
thereafter to the states for their reviewto have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
purposes of the delegates because congress and the state legislatures
were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made unanimous
ratification as events proved would have been impossible therefore
the delegates decided that the constitution should be sent to congress
with the recommendation that it in turn transmit the document not to
the state legislatures but to conventions held in the states for the
special object of deciding upon ratification this process was followed
it was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
the state legislaturesthe convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
number of states necessary to establish the new constitution attempts
to change the articles had failed because amendment required the
approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
member of the union the opposition to a new constitution was
undoubtedly formidable rhode island had even refused to take part in
framing it and her hostility was deep and open so the convention cast
aside the provision of the articles of confederation which required
unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government it decreed
that the new constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
statesin providing for future changes in the constitution itself the
convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval and
decided that an amendment could be made on a two thirds vote in both
houses of congress and ratification by three fourths of the states this
change was of profound significance every state agreed to be bound in
the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
them itself america in this way set out upon the high road that led
from a league of states to a nation
the struggle over ratificationon september 17 1787 the constitution having been finally drafted in
clear and simple language a model to all makers of fundamental law was
adopted the convention after nearly four months of debate in secret
session flung open the doors and presented to the americans the
finished plan for the new government then the great debate passed to
the people the opposition   storms of criticism at once descended upon the
constitution fraudulent usurpation  exclaimed gerry who had refused
to sign it a monster out of the thick veil of secrecy declaimed a
pennsylvania newspaper an iron handed despotism will be the result
protested a third we the low born sarcastically wrote a fourth
will now admit the six hundred well born immediately to establish
this most noble most excellent and truly divine constitution the
president will become a king congress will be as tyrannical as
parliament in the old days the states will be swallowed up the rights
of the people will be trampled upon the poor mans justice will be lost
in the endless delays of the federal courts  such was the strain of the
protests against ratification illustration an advertisement of the federalist  defense of the constitution   moved by the tempest of opposition
hamilton madison and jay took up their pens in defense of the
constitution in a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
expounded with eloquence learning and dignity every important clause
and provision of the proposed plan these papers afterwards collected
and published in a volume known as the federalist form the finest
textbook on the constitution that has ever been printed it takes its
place moreover among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
ever written in any language in any time other men not so gifted were
no less earnest in their support of ratification in private
correspondence editorials pamphlets and letters to the newspapers
they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
constitution which in spite of any defects great or small was the
only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
weakness abroad illustration celebrating the ratification  the action of the state conventions   before the end of the year
1787 three states had ratified the constitution delaware and new
jersey unanimously and pennsylvania after a short though savage
contest connecticut and georgia followed early the next year then came
the battle royal in massachusetts ending in ratification in february by
the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168 in the spring came the news that
maryland and south carolina were under the new roof on june 21 new
hampshire where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
constitution joined the new republic influenced by the favorable
decision in massachusetts swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
new york and virginia where the question of ratification was still
undecided nine states had accepted it and were united whether more saw
fit to join or notmeanwhile however virginia after a long and searching debate had
given her approval by a narrow margin leaving new york as the next seat
of anxiety in that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification events
finally demonstrated the futility of resistance and hamilton by good
judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
of thirty to twenty seven votes in favor of ratificationthe great contest was over all the states except north carolina and
rhode island had ratified the sloop anarchy wrote an ebullient
journalist when last heard from was ashore on union rocks the first election   in the autumn of 1788 elections were held to
fill the places in the new government public opinion was overwhelmingly
in favor of washington as the first president yielding to the
importunities of friends he accepted the post in the spirit of public
service on april 30 1789 he took the oath of office at federal hall
in new york city long live george washington president of the united
states  cried chancellor livingston as soon as the general had kissed
the bible the cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back

chapter viiithe clash of political parties
the men and measures of the new government friends of the constitution in power   in the first congress that
assembled after the adoption of the constitution there were eleven
senators led by robert morris the financier who had been delegates to
the national convention several members of the house of
representatives headed by james madison had also been at philadelphia
in 1787 in making his appointments washington strengthened the new
system of government still further by a judicious selection of
officials he chose as secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton
who had been the most zealous for its success general knox head of the
war department and edmund randolph the attorney general were likewise
conspicuous friends of the experiment every member of the federal
judiciary whom washington appointed from the chief justice john jay
down to the justices of the district courts had favored the
ratification of the constitution and a majority of them had served as
members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
state ratifying conventions only one man of influence in the new
government thomas jefferson the secretary of state was reckoned as a
doubter in the house of the faithful he had expressed opinions both for
and against the constitution but he had been out of the country acting
as the minister at paris when the constitution was drafted and ratified an opposition to conciliate   the inauguration of washington amid the
plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification the
interesting nature of the question wrote john marshall the equality
of the parties the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted the
leaders gathered around washington were well aware of the excited state
of the country they saw rhode island and north carolina still outside
of the union 1  they knew by what small margins the constitution had
been approved in the great states of massachusetts virginia and new
york they were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions
in yielding reluctant approval to the constitution had drawn a number
of amendments for immediate submission to the states the first amendments  a bill of rights   to meet the opposition
madison proposed and the first congress adopted a series of amendments
to the constitution ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a
part of the law of the land these amendments provided among other
things that congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
religion abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
redress of grievances they also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
crimes to reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
invaded by the federal government the tenth amendment expressly
provided that the powers not delegated to the united states by the
constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the
states respectively or to the people seven years later the eleventh
amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten after a
heated debate over the action of the supreme court in permitting a
citizen to bring a suit against the sovereign state of georgia the
new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
a citizen funding the national debt   paper declarations of rights however
paid no bills to this task hamilton turned all his splendid genius at
the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
debt daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated in a report on
public credit under date of january 9 1790 one of the first and
greatest of american state papers he laid before congress the outlines
of his plan he proposed that the federal government should call in all
the old bonds certificates of indebtedness and other promises to pay
which had been issued by the congress since the beginning of the
revolution these national obligations he urged should be put into one
consolidated debt resting on the credit of the united states to the
holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
fixed rates this process was called funding the debt such a
provision for the support of public credit hamilton insisted would
satisfy creditors restore landed property to its former value and
furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
and capital assumption and funding of state debts   hamilton then turned to the
obligations incurred by the several states in support of the revolution
these debts he proposed to add to the national debt they were to be
assumed by the united states government and placed on the same secure
foundation as the continental debt this measure he defended not merely
on grounds of national honor it would as he foresaw give strength to
the new national government by making all public creditors men of
substance in their several communities look to the federal rather than
the state government for the satisfaction of their claims funding at face value   on the question of the terms of consolidation
assumption and funding hamilton had a firm conviction that millions
of dollars worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
support of the government or had sold supplies for the revolutionary
army was well known it was also a matter of common knowledge that a
very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
figures  ten twenty and thirty cents on the dollar accordingly it
had been suggested even in very respectable quarters that a
discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
purchasers some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
outlays and the original holders paid the difference others said that
the government should scale the debt by redeeming not at full value
but at a figure reasonably above the market price against the
proposition hamilton set his face like flint he maintained that the
government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value
although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
another part funding and assumption carried   there was little difficulty in
securing the approval of both houses of congress for the funding of the
national debt at full value the bill for the assumption of state debts
however brought the sharpest division of opinions to the southern
members of congress assumption was a gross violation of states rights
without any warrant in the constitution and devised in the interest of
northern speculators who anticipating assumption and funding had
bought up at low prices the southern bonds and other promises to pay
new england on the other hand was strongly in favor of assumption
several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated to this dispute was
added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
capital then temporarily at new york city illustration first united states bank at philadelphia a deadlock accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides
threatened the very existence of the young government washington and
hamilton were thoroughly alarmed hearing of the extremity to which the
contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the secretary of
the treasury jefferson intervened at this point by skillful management
at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together and thus once
more as on many other occasions peace was purchased and the union
saved by compromise the bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital enough
southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill and a majority
was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
potomac after locating it for a ten year period at philadelphia to
satisfy pennsylvania members the united states bank   encouraged by the success of his funding and
assumption measures hamilton laid before congress a project for a great
united states bank he proposed that a private corporation be chartered
by congress authorized to raise a capital stock of $10000000
three fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one fourth in
specie and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards
many advantages hamilton contended would accrue to the government from
this institution the price of the government bonds would be increased
thus enhancing public credit a national currency would be created of
uniform value from one end of the land to the other the branches of the
bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
commercial transactions on a national scale finally through the issue
of bank notes the money capital available for agriculture and industry
would be increased thus stimulating business enterprise jefferson
hotly attacked the bank on the ground that congress had no power
whatever under the constitution to charter such a private corporation
hamilton defended it with great cogency washington after weighing all
opinions decided in favor of the proposal in 1791 the bill
establishing the first united states bank for a period of twenty years
became a law the protective tariff   a third part of hamiltons program was the
protection of american industries the first revenue act of 1789 though
designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury declared in
favor of the principle the following year washington referred to the
subject in his address to congress thereupon hamilton was instructed to
prepare recommendations for legislative action the result after a
delay of more than a year was his report on manufactures another
state paper worthy in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
understanding of a place beside his report on public credit hamilton
based his argument on the broadest national grounds the protective
tariff would by encouraging the building of factories create a home
market for the produce of farms and plantations by making the united
states independent of other countries in times of peace it would double
its security in time of war by making use of the labor of women and
children it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
idle or only partly employed by increasing the trade between the north
and south it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
ties those of commerce and intercourse the revenue measure of 1792 bore
the impress of these arguments
the rise of political parties dissensions over hamiltons measures   hamiltons plans touching
deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
states awakened alarm and opposition funding at face value said his
critics was a government favor to speculators the assumption of state
debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments congress had
no constitutional power to create a bank the law creating the bank
merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
a high rate of interest and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
the benefit of manufacturershamiltons reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
straightforward some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
of the debt at face value but that was only an incident in the
restoration of public credit in view of the jealousies of the states it
was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions the
constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
national needs the bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
needed to start up american industries giving markets to farmers and
planters the tariff by creating a home market and increasing
opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor out of
such wise policies firmly pursued by the government he concluded were
bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home
credit and power abroad this view washington fully indorsed adding
the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
adopted under his administration the sharpness of the partisan conflict   as a result of the clash of
opinion the people of the country gradually divided into two parties
federalists and anti federalists the former led by hamilton the latter
by jefferson the strength of the federalists lay in the cities  boston
providence hartford new york philadelphia charleston  among the
manufacturing financial and commercial groups of the population who
were eager to extend their business operations the strength of the
anti federalists lay mainly among the debt burdened farmers who feared
the growth of what they called a money power and planters in all
sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
interests the farming and planting south outside of the few towns
finally presented an almost solid front against assumption the bank
and the tariff the conflict between the parties grew steadily in
bitterness despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
constant efforts of washington to soften the asperity of the
contestants the leadership and doctrines of jefferson   the party dispute had not
gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
jefferson as their leader some of hamiltons measures he had approved
declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
significance others particularly the bank he fiercely assailed more
than once he and hamilton shaking violently with anger attacked each
other at cabinet meetings and nothing short of the grave and dignified
pleas of washington prevented an early and open break between them in
1794 it finally came jefferson resigned as secretary of state and
retired to his home in virginia to assume through correspondence and
negotiation the leadership of the steadily growing party of oppositionshy and modest in manner halting in speech disliking the turmoil of
public debate and deeply interested in science and philosophy
jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
contest nevertheless he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator he was
also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
hamilton the latter believed in a strong active high toned
government vigorously compelling in all its branches jefferson looked
upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
uprisings hamilton distrusted the people your people is a great
beast he is reported to have said jefferson professed his faith in
the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his timeon economic matters the opinions of the two leaders were also
hopelessly at variance hamilton while cherishing agriculture desired
to see america a great commercial and industrial nation jefferson was
equally set against this course for his country he feared the
accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class
the mobs of great cities he said are sores on the body politic
artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions
workshops should be kept in europe and with them the artisans with their
insidious morals and manners the only substantial foundation for a
republic jefferson believed to be agriculture the spirit of
independence could be kept alive only by free farmers owning the land
they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
hands for their sustenance trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
human nature when nourished on a free soil jefferson advocated those
measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
persons rather than the powers of government thus he became the
champion of the individual against the interference of the government
and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press freedom of speech and
freedom of scientific inquiry it was accordingly no mere factious
spirit that drove him into opposition to hamilton the whisky rebellion   the political agitation of the anti federalists
was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794 the
occasion for this uprising was another of hamiltons measures a law
laying an excise tax on distilled spirits for the purpose of increasing
the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt it so
happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
country was made by the farmers especially on the frontier in their
own stills the new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
come into the homes of the people measure their liquor and take the
tax out of their pockets all the bitterness which farmers felt against
the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled in the western
districts of pennsylvania virginia and north carolina they refused to
pay the tax in pennsylvania some of them sacked and burned the houses
of the tax collectors as the revolutionists thirty years before had
mobbed the agents of king george sent over to sell stamps they were in
a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when washington called
out the troops to suppress the whisky rebellion then the movement
collapsed but it left behind a deep seated resentment which flared up
in the election of several obdurate anti federalist congressmen from the
disaffected regions
foreign influences and domestic politics the french revolution   in this exciting period when all america was
distracted by partisan disputes a storm broke in europe  the
epoch making french revolution  which not only shook the thrones of the
old world but stirred to its depths the young republic of the new world
the first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789
a few days after washington was inaugurated the king of france louis
xvi driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars was forced
to resort to his people for financial help accordingly he called for
the first time in more than one hundred fifty years a meeting of the
national parliament the estates general composed of representatives
of the three estates  the clergy nobility and commoners acting
under powerful leaders the commoners or third estate swept aside
the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
assembly this stirred the country to its depths illustration from an old printlouis xvi in the hands of the mob great events followed in swift succession on july 14 1789 the
bastille an old royal prison symbol of the kings absolutism was
stormed by a paris crowd and destroyed on the night of august 4 the
feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
assembly amid great excitement a few days later came the famous
declaration of the rights of man proclaiming the sovereignty of the
people and the privileges of citizens in the autumn of 1791 louis xvi
was forced to accept a new constitution for france vesting the
legislative power in a popular assembly little disorder accompanied
these startling changes to all appearances a peaceful revolution had
stripped the french king of his royal prerogatives and based the
government of his country on the consent of the governed american influence in france   in undertaking their great political
revolt the french had been encouraged by the outcome of the american
revolution officers and soldiers who had served in the american war
reported to their french countrymen marvelous tales at the frugal table
of general washington in council with the unpretentious franklin or at
conferences over the strategy of war french noblemen of ancient lineage
learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas travelers
who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes
carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
system of popular governmenton the other hand the dalliance with american democracy was regarded by
french conservatives as playing with fire when we think of the false
ideas of government and philanthropy wrote one of lafayettes aides
which these youths acquired in america and propagated in france with so
much enthusiasm and such deplorable success  for this mania of imitation
powerfully aided the revolution though it was not the sole cause of
it  we are bound to confess that it would have been better both for
themselves and for us if these young philosophers in red heeled shoes
had stayed at home in attendance on the court early american opinion of the french revolution   so close were the
ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
step in the first stages of the french revolution greeted with applause
in the united states liberty will have another feather in her cap
exultantly wrote a boston editor in no part of the globe soberly
wrote john marshall was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
america but one sentiment existed the main key to the bastille
sent to washington as a memento was accepted as a token of the
victory gained by liberty thomas paine saw in the great event the
first ripe fruits of american principles transplanted into europe
federalists and anti federalists regarded the new constitution of france
as another vindication of american ideals the reign of terror   while profuse congratulations were being
exchanged rumors began to come that all was not well in france many
noblemen enraged at the loss of their special privileges fled into
germany and plotted an invasion of france to overthrow the new system of
government louis xvi entered into negotiations with his brother
monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise
and he finally betrayed to the french people his true sentiments by
attempting to escape from his kingdom only to be captured and taken
back to paris in disgracea new phase of the revolution now opened the working people excluded
from all share in the government by the first french constitution
became restless especially in paris assembling on the champs de mars
a great open field they signed a petition calling for another
constitution giving them the suffrage when told to disperse they
refused and were fired upon by the national guard this massacre as
it was called enraged the populace a radical party known as
jacobins then sprang up taking its name from a jacobin monastery in
which it held its sessions in a little while it became the master of
the popular convention convoked in september 1792 the monarchy was
immediately abolished and a republic established on january 21 1793
louis was sent to the scaffold to the war on austria already raging
was added a war on england then came the reign of terror during which
radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
counter revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
monarchy they shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
rule and established a relentless dictatorship civil war followed
terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty
and in the name of monarchy to americans of conservative temper it now
seemed that the revolution so auspiciously begun had degenerated into
anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife burke summons the world to war on france   in england edmund burke
led the fight against the new french principles which he feared might
spread to all europe in his reflections on the french revolution
written in 1790 he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
popular government he called for war relentless war upon the french
as monsters and outlaws he demanded that they be reduced to order by
the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
arms of european nations paines defense of the french revolution   to counteract the campaign
of hate against the french thomas paine replied to burke in another of
his famous tracts the rights of man which was given to the american
public in an edition containing a letter of approval from jefferson
burke said paine had been mourning about the glories of the french
monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
oppressed people had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
bird burke had denied the right of the french people to choose their
own governors blandly forgetting that the english government in which
he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions he had boasted
that the king of england held his crown in contempt of the democratic
societies paine answered if i ask a man in america if he wants a
king he retorts and asks me if i take him for an idiot to the charge
that the doctrines of the rights of man were new fangled paine
replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
whether they were right or wrong as to the french disorders and
difficulties he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
in due time the effect of the french revolution on american politics   the course
of the french revolution and the controversies accompanying it
exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
parties in america the followers of hamilton now proud of the name
federalists drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
committed during the reign of terror they turned savagely upon the
revolutionists and their friends in america denouncing as jacobin
everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
french republic a massachusetts preacher roundly assailed the
atheistical anarchical and in other respects immoral principles of the
french republicans he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
jefferson and the anti federalists whom he charged with spreading false
french propaganda and betraying america the editors patrons and
abettors of these vehicles of slander he exclaimed ought to be
considered and treated as enemies to their country of all traitors
they are the most aggravatedly criminal of all villains they are the
most infamous and detestablethe anti federalists as a matter of fact were generally favorable to
the revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
it paines pamphlet indorsed by jefferson was widely read democratic
societies after the fashion of french political clubs arose in the
cities the coalition of european monarchs against france was denounced
as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism and the
execution of louis xvi was openly celebrated at a banquet in
philadelphia harmless titles such as sir the honorable and his
excellency were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
insisted on adopting the french title citizen speaking for example
of citizen judge and citizen toastmaster pamphlets in defense of
the french streamed from the press while subsidized newspapers kept the
propaganda in full swing the european war disturbs american commerce   this battle of wits or
rather contest in calumny might have gone on indefinitely in america
without producing any serious results had it not been for the war
between england and france then raging the english having command of
the seas claimed the right to seize american produce bound for french
ports and to confiscate american ships engaged in carrying french goods
adding fuel to a fire already hot enough they began to search american
ships and to carry off british born sailors found on board american
vessels the french appeal for help   at the same time the french republic
turned to the united states for aid in its war on england and sent over
as its diplomatic representative citizen genet an ardent supporter of
the new order on his arrival at charleston he was greeted with fervor
by the anti federalists as he made his way north he was wined and
dined and given popular ovations that turned his head he thought the
whole country was ready to join the french republic in its contest with
england genet therefore attempted to use the american ports as the base
of operations for french privateers preying on british merchant ships
and he insisted that the united states was in honor bound to help france
under the treaty of 1778 the proclamation of neutrality and the jay treaty   unmoved by therising tide of popular sympathy for france washington took a firm
course he received genet coldly the demand that the united states aid
france under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
neutrality of america and warning american citizens against hostile acts
toward either france or england when genet continued to hold meetings
issue manifestoes and stir up the people against england washington
asked the french government to recall him this act he followed up by
sending the chief justice john jay on a pacific mission to englandthe result was the celebrated jay treaty of 1794 by its terms great
britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
trade concessions the chief sources of bitterness  the failure of the
british to return slaves carried off during the revolution the seizure
of american ships and the impressment of sailors  were not touched
much to the distress of everybody in america including loyal
federalists nevertheless washington dreading an armed conflict with
england urged the senate to ratify the treaty the weight of his
influence carried the dayat this the hostility of the anti federalists knew no bounds jefferson
declared the jay treaty an infamous act which is really nothing more
than an alliance between england and the anglo men of this country
against the legislature and the people of the united states hamilton
defending it with his usual courage was stoned by a mob in new york and
driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face jay was
burned in effigy even washington was not spared the house of
representatives was openly hostile to display its feelings it called
upon the president for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations
only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them on
the ground that the house did not share in the treaty making power washington retires from politics   such angry contests confirmed the
president in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
his second term in office he did not believe that a third term was
unconstitutional or improper but worn out by his long and arduous
labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
friends he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at mount
vernonin september 1796 on the eve of the presidential election washington
issued his farewell address another state paper to be treasured and
read by generations of americans to come in this address he directed
the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest he
warned them against sectional jealousies he remonstrated against the
spirit of partisanship saying that in government of the popular
character in government purely elective it is a spirit not to be
encouraged he likewise cautioned the people against the insidious
wiles of foreign influence saying europe has a set of primary
interests which to us have none or a very remote relation hence she
must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are
essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it would be
unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary
vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
of her friendships or enmities why forego the advantages of so
peculiar a situation? it is our true policy to steer clear of
permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world taking
care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a
respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary
alliances for extraordinary emergencies the campaign of 1796  adams elected   on hearing of the retirement of
washington the anti federalists cast off all restraints in honor of
france and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
monarchical tendencies of the federalists they boldly assumed the name
republican the term democrat then applied only to obscure and
despised radicals had not come into general use they selected
jefferson as their candidate for president against john adams the
federalist nominee and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
came within four votes of electing himthe successful candidate adams was not fitted by training or opinion
for conciliating a determined opposition he was a reserved and studious
man he was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator in one of
his books he had declared himself in favor of government by an
aristocracy of talents and wealth  an offense which the republicans
never forgave while john marshall found him a sensible plain candid
good tempered man jefferson could see in him nothing but a monocrat
and anglo man had it not been for the conduct of the french
government adams would hardly have enjoyed a moments genuine
popularity during his administration the quarrel with france   the french directory the executive
department established under the constitution of 1795 managed however
to stir the anger of republicans and federalists alike it regarded the
jay treaty as a rebuke to france and a flagrant violation of obligations
solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778 accordingly it refused to
receive the american minister treated him in a humiliating way and
finally told him to leave the country overlooking this affront in his
anxiety to maintain peace adams dispatched to france a commission of
eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the french
republic on their arrival they were chagrined to find instead of a
decent reception an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
conduct of the american government a payment in cash and an annual
tribute as the price of continued friendship when the news of this
affair reached president adams he promptly laid it before congress
referring to the frenchmen who had made the demands as mr x mr y
and mr zthis insult coupled with the fact that french privateers like the
british were preying upon american commerce enraged even the
republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their french
sympathies they forgot their wrath over the jay treaty and joined with
the federalists in shouting millions for defense not a cent for
tribute  preparations for war were made on every hand washington was
once more called from mount vernon to take his old position at the head
of the army indeed fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800 by that time
the directory had been overthrown a treaty was readily made with
napoleon the first consul who was beginning his remarkable career as
chief of the french republic soon to be turned into an empire alien and sedition laws   flushed with success the federalists
determined if possible to put an end to radical french influence in
america and to silence republican opposition they therefore passed two
drastic laws in the summer of 1798 the alien and sedition actsthe first of these measures empowered the president to expel from the
country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as dangerous or had
reasonable grounds to suspect of any treasonable or secret
express permission
