calculating fitness is one task for the threadpool - parallelized
look into better line drawing - Bresenham line draw -- in progress
line width -- sorta  -- in progress
see what is causing termination - iterations? selector?
print out fitness functino as it improves to see if it improves
kill bad ones -- done
curvature 
start with only colors sampled from image -- DONE
be able to change the colors to be more fit - DONE
half red half green test - reds to one side greens ot the other
look into making lines shorter or having a max length

parallelize selector maybe, especially maximize
optimal stroke min and max length
command line args
reducing any non deterministic problem to a fitness problem


show fitness as it increases with animation
maximum fiteness and median fitness as it moves

how much can using a genetic algorithm improve just good selection in the first place? what is the optimal value? 
FLAGS
min width
selectors
swap "size" and "numstrokes" for n and s
output file name, number of samples to save

implement stroke length min and max as well
